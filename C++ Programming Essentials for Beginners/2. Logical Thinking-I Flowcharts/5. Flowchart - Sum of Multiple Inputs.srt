1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,040
Everyone in this example, we will look at how do you handle multiple inputs inside a flow chart, OK?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,860
The question is taken would end.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,130
So we have to first read the value of an OK and followed by inward numbers.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,520
So for example, in this case, we had first given the value of and that is food, then we are followed

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,990
by four more numbers that we have to read.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,980
And then we have to find that sum.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,110
So this some is nothing but one one zero.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,770
OK.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,430
The end could be anything, if any, stent.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,330
We have to read 10 words.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,850
If an is 50, we have to read 15 words, OK?

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,460
Now you cannot create and number of buckets to read.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,120
Such numbers, okay, so what we have to do, we have to read and process the Sun as we go through the

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,430
input, okay, so we have to read.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,010
And update some.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,590
Simultaneously, for example, if I give you a number 10.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,340
So in your mind, you create a bucket called sum, OK?

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:18,450
And knew is initially zero, then you know the sum is nothing but 0+ and that is equal to and OK, next

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,370
time I took it, read the number 20.

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,650
So you add 22 years.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,210
So the sum now becomes thirty years during what is the current sum?

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,610
Then I ask your grade.

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,310
The next number that is 30.

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,580
So you are 32.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,170
The sum, it becomes 60.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,550
Next time I ask you to read the next number, that is 50.

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,680
So you added tourism and it becomes one, 110 or so, do you think will require a use of loop?

28
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,710
And in this loop, we are also going to update this, OK?

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,140
Let's see how many buckets we will need.

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,260
So one bucket we will need to store.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,510
What is the value of in that is food.

32
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:07,820
Another bucket we will need to count, which, no, we are doing OK, so the first number, the value

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,310
of I is one when we go to the second number.

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,310
The value of I is two when we go to the third number.

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,420
The value of our history.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,860
When we go to the fourth number, the value of his food.

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,690
So I denotes which number we are eating.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,140
OK.

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,460
So another bucket.

40
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,090
I denotes which bucket we're reading.

41
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,540
Another bucket.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,500
We need to know the value of the current number.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,820
Suppose I is one.

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,490
What is the first number that we are reading?

45
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,320
The first number is nothing but 10.

46
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,310
So this will go ahead.

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,780
OK.

48
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,080
Another bucket to ensure.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,970
What does the sum belong to?

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,070
The sum till now is zero.

51
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,370
Then we read, then we add 10 to the sum.

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,590
Then we read 20.

53
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,360
Then we add 22.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,750
The sum.

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,080
OK.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,300
So I hope you're getting some idea of what all buckets we will need to create.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,110
And now let's see how we can create the flow chart.

58
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,530
OK.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,110
So first of all, we will have start.

60
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,820
As usual, then we will read the well, you often will say, OK, let's read.

61
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,860
The number and.

62
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,800
Then what what next?

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,300
We need to know the count.

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,670
OK.

65
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,290
So we need to say, OK, we're going to read the first number, the value of this one and how many numbers

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,400
we want to read.

67
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,450
We want to read and numbers on what is this some now, some below zero.

68
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,060
OK.

69
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,630
To tell what point we are going to read.

70
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,530
Let's see.

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,080
So we are going to read a little.

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,700
I is less than equal to and because we are going to read let us defend his vote, we are only going

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,890
to try and look four times.

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,590
So if I is less than equal to end, if the answer is yes, we will take it.

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,660
Read the current value.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,890
How do we read it?

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,100
We read the current value.

78
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,900
We read it.

79
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,180
And now what are you going to do?

80
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,890
You can do two things.

81
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,860
One thing is you will update the sum, OK?

82
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:27,930
So you will update the Sun so you can see some equals, some less value.

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,190
OK, next thing, you will increment the count.

84
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,660
You will talk, I equals I +1.

85
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
That is another thing that you will do.

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
And then again, you will connect back here.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,250
You will again going to back it.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,150
And if the answer is no.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,360
Then you know that, OK, I have computed the sum I can print it.

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,030
Do you will talk rent the value of some?

91
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,160
And then you can simply say exit.

92
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,220
Now, let us brighten this code for our given input.

93
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,640
So the input we are given and is Ford, OK?

94
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:26,570
And is Ford, and we are given some numbers, let's say 30, 50, 20 and later than that, these are

95
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,170
the numbers.

96
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,110
If what is I is one.

97
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,800
Is one less than equal when one is less than equal, the 40th will read the value.

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,690
What is the value that we will read?

99
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,560
The next input that is available from the keyboard that will go into the value to the value is 30.

100
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,560
The value is 30, and we update about something as simple as value, so sum becomes zero plus 30 to

101
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,490
some becomes 30.

102
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,290
All right.

103
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,210
I becomes what I becomes to who is less than equal to for.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,870
We will redouble you to the next number from the keyboard and productively that will go into the value.

105
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,220
The values 50, some becomes 30 plus $50, 80.

106
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,270
OK, next time I began to three.

107
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,710
Three is less than equal to four values, the next value that is this number.

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,310
We are reading the third number, OK?

109
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,430
We are reading the third number.

110
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,420
And we lose 20, so some becomes 80 plus 20.

111
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,030
That is Android.

112
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,900
And finally, we read the next number that is equal to Ford or is less than equal to Ford.

113
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,990
And we read the value that is 10.

114
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,410
And we update us here, so some equals.

115
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,490
Under less than.

116
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,600
Which becomes one 110, and we update.

117
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,530
The eye becomes five, so then I becomes five.

118
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,810
We again come here, which is five, then equal to four Dhanteras.

119
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,100
No.

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
We print the sum.

121
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,290
And what is the final value of some?

122
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,390
It is 110, so we get the output at 110 and we exit.

123
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,490
That's how we can handle the processing of multiple inputs.

124
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:27,650
Okay?

125
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,520
So in this example, we do not need to store all the numbers at once.

126
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,220
We are only storing the current number, OK?

127
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,120
But in some problems, we might require to store all the numbers.

128
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,900
And later on, in the course, you will learn about data centers to one data center that can be used

129
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,740
for storage.

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,030
It's called as Eddy.

131
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,590
OK.

132
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,730
It's called Azadi that would be covered in the later topics, not in this topic.

133
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,420
So I hope you have understood how to handle multiple inputs inside a flowchart, and that's all for

134
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,960
this video.
