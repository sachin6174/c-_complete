1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,700
Alright, so let us do one more problem on flowcharts and this problem, we want to find the greatest

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,410
common divisor of two numbers, OK?

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,060
And it is also known as DCD on Etsy.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,140
If, for example, let's say there is a number that is eight, it is a number B that has led to 12.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,550
So what is the largest number that divides both of these numbers?

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:23,800
OK.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,660
So by.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,200
And division we can do this number is nothing went forward.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,460
What is the largest number that will divide eight and 12 would.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,930
OK, for example, is eight and B is letter 24.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,990
In this case, the DCT would be nothing but it because it divides aid.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,120
And it also divides 24.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,100
And maybe there is a no, let's say is nine.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:01:01,360
And let's be is living in this case, the desert is one that is no common divisor except one between

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,320
the two numbers, OK?

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:11,410
So if you look carefully, you can see that if you have a number a, it's A and a No.

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:11,680
B.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:21,790
We can clearly see that the DCD of these numbers and we would always be less than equal to minimum of

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,570
the two numbers.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,200
OK.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,040
It would always be less than equal to a minimum of two numbers.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,870
So, for example, is it and B is 12?

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,670
You cannot have a number that is greater than the smaller number that will divide both, OK?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,390
So you cannot say I will have a number 10 that will also divide it.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,770
No, this is not possible.

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,540
The decree would always be less than or equal to the minimum of two numbers and the minimum value of

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,780
a number that can divide both the numbers would be one.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,950
So we can say that the DCD would lie in the range.

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,170
Think from one to the minimum of.

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,420
A common be, OK?

31
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,090
This would be the end so that we know that our answer would always lie in this range.

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,880
OK, so we are trying to build a very brute force logic for computing logically.

33
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,980
Again, we are going to try out all possibilities what numbers can be a desired offer given them, but.

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,970
To this, we know, and if we know this, we can easily I dread over the strange using the loop.

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,990
And now we want to find out the greatest number in this range, which divides what end.

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,040
So let us see how we will build this particular algorithm.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,470
Let's dig an example, let's say.

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,380
Is it?

39
00:02:52,390 --> 00:03:00,010
And let it be is Wendy makes it to what is minimum of a.

40
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,090
It is, of course, it will outrage over the range.

41
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,140
One two three four five six seven eight.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,680
In the beginning, we attract one.

43
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,920
Does one divide A and B none.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,580
Three Yes.

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,540
And we will have we will update our decision.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,500
OK, so what is the largest number we have seen that divides both?

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
That number is nothing but one.

48
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,950
We go to do those to divide and us to divide be the answer is yes.

49
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,660
So we will update our DCD studios to those three divide, but it does not divide it.

50
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,450
It does not divide 20 does four divide eight and 20?

51
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,580
Yes, it divides the four divides eight and four divides 20.

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,050
So hence the decision is for now we go to five.

53
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,270
Does not divide, does not divide.

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,080
We go to six.

55
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,760
Does not divide.

56
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,840
Does not divide.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,980
We go to seven.

58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,030
Does not divide.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Does not divide.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,760
We go to eight.

61
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,410
It divides eight.

62
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,540
But it does not divide 20.

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,640
OK, so that means.

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,020
And what would be the value of these hidden all these iterations?

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,340
We have not updated the value of decision in all of these arbitrations.

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,550
Finally, the DCD would be nothing but forward.

67
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,260
OK, the decision would be same.

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,130
That would be for.

69
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,230
So we've found all three numbers one, two and four that divides, what, 18 20.

70
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:40,880
Hence the largest number as forward and hence the decision is for now, take a pause and think, can

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,610
you come up with a flowchart to solve this problem?

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,330
OK, now let us discuss the solution.

73
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,410
Let's solve using a flowchart.

74
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,330
The first step would be start.

75
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,280
As usual, then it would be read they're doing numbers that is read and be.

76
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,020
And now what we are going to do, we are going to initialize what we are doing to initialize led to

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,640
AI that is equal to one.

78
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:24,210
And we're going to go to a minimum of envy, so if I is less than equal to a minimum of a comma B.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,490
OK.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,330
If it does, yes.

81
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,150
So what we are going to do is we are going to check.

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,500
If I divides and divides me also, so we are again going to put our decision box here.

83
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Is a divisible by.

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,820
And be divisible by.

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,390
If the answer is yes, OK?

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,810
Then what we are going to do.

87
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,250
We are going to update our DVD.

88
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,520
We are going to say that what do you see is equal, do I because I is the largest number so far we have

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,330
seen that divides both NBA?

90
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:17,110
That divides both N.B., so we have to complete this brand of norm, and we have to complete this brand

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
of noise with.

92
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,700
So after updating this will do we will go to the next day.

93
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,960
That is I will do I +1.

94
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,580
And even if I does not divide and we would, then also we will go to the snakes branch and we will say,

95
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,870
OK.

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,870
I was, too.

97
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,880
A-plus.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,300
What?

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,600
And from here, we are again going to connect bucket.

100
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,660
We are again going to connect bank it, so if we come out of the loop, that means we have explored

101
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,440
all options.

102
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
What we are going to do.

103
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,220
We are going to bring the value of diversity so we can bring.

104
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,310
The do you study the greatest common divisor, and that's it.

105
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,210
Not X-rated.

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,450
OK.

107
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,810
We are done.

108
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,300
Now, let us try to brighten this cold for, let's say.

109
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,890
Six on foot.

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:21,850
OK.

111
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,800
It's a six and B is.

112
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,020
Later, this is what end is will run this code from one to four.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:40,370
OK, so when I choose, one is one less than minimum of N.B., so minimum of India's vote, so is four

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,540
divisible by one.

115
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,760
Is six divisible by one, yes, is Florida eligible were one, yes.

116
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,940
So what we do?

117
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,090
Do you think we're the ones over these three days?

118
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,390
One?

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,090
Great.

120
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,480
We go to makes no I equal I plus one, I becomes too.

121
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,540
Is six divisible by one for divisible by 200?

122
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,470
Yes, we are going to go ahead and we update a verdict.

123
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you see this?

124
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,350
Do we go to three?

125
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,820
The next number that is three is six divisible by three, yes, is four divisible.

126
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,010
No, we do not update our duty.

127
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,300
We simply take this route and go to the next number.

128
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,900
We go to four is six divisible by four.

129
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,280
No is four divisible by four.

130
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:26,700
Yes.

131
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,770
So we don't update our destiny.

132
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,890
So this really remains same.

133
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,620
That is true.

134
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,920
So finally, we make is five.

135
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,410
And five is not less than equal to minimum of envy, so what we do, we come out of this loop, we bring

136
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,360
the GST and then we exit.

137
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,710
That's all.

138
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,420
That is how we have computed the OECD using a very basic solution, OK, data optimized algorithms to

139
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,840
do it.

140
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,460
That is a Euclid's algorithm, but that would be that would not be covered yet.

141
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,530
It's slightly advanced algorithm, and this is the most basic way of computing the DCT.

142
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,520
That's all for this video.

143
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,050
Thank you.
