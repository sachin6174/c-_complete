00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,280
Everyone.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,190
So let us discuss this problem of finding simple interest and in order to compute simple interest,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,060
we need three things we need to know the principal amount.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,300
The rate of interest on diamond years.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,080
And if given to these three things, you can simply compute the simple interest OK.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,610
So you might have done it in school level maths.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,070
We also know the formula for simple interest is given as principal that is denoted using be multiplied,

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,300
but it multiplied by time and divided by 100 OK.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,780
For example, if your principal is 100, the rate is five and dime is two.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,820
And if you divide it with 100, it gives you the value, then it gives you the value and.

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,240
Now, this is what the simple interest is.

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:01,690
Now suppose we want to write a program or we want to write a flowchart for this problem.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,270
Let's see what steps we have to follow.

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,740
So as we discussed, the first step would always be start, OK, the next step in this problem is to

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,450
take input because once you have the input only, then you can process your data.

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,080
That will take input and we will read three numbers.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
That is the principal date and time.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,550
OK, so doing this step will create three buckets in the memory.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,760
OK, so one bucket will store the principal.

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,920
Another bucket will store the read.

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,160
Another bucket will store the name.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,540
OK, and now we are saying that, OK, we are going to process simple interest.

23
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,370
So we are creating another bucket whose name is simple interest.

24
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,060
And we are evaluating the value of this expression.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,770
So we are multiplying three numbers 1.5 and two dividing it with a constant that is under it, and we

26
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:03,240
are storing the result here that is going to store the value in here.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,570
OK.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,600
That means if we deposit 200 rupees at a five percent interest for a period of two years, we will get.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,990
Ben Rubies as a simple interest.

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,550
So let's see, let's put it in the simple interest that will bring the value of this bucket that Dennis

31
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,060
printed.

32
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,380
And here we were, consuming three inputs under advisement.

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,310
OK.

34
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,140
They go as input.

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,020
And this simple interest is the output.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,160
And that's it.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,600
Now we are done with the process and hence we write them.

38
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,430
And that's it.

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,990
That is how simple it is to draw a flowchart.

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,170
So I hope this problem is clear for you in the next video.
