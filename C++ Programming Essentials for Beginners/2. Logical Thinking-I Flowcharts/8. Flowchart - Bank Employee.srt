1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,090
Everyone in this lecture will discuss the real world example of flowchart.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:05,500
OK.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,650
Just to make of it in this tiny little mode better the question as a bank is open till six pm and the

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,850
banker needs to process requests from the customers, OK?

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:24,200
The requests can be of one of the four types Guy's deposit, cash withdrawal, check deposit and making

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,980
or demand draft.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,160
We want to draw the flowchart of a bank employee.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,410
Now, the bank employee can process one of these requests, but we also need to see that the customer

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,130
can enter the bank if it is open.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,880
So let us see how the flowchart would look like.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,630
So if you want, you can spend two minutes to think and try to come up with a solution of your own.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,520
Otherwise, we had the solution and we will discuss this solution with you, OK?

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,250
So the flowchart will start from the first step.

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,810
The bank gets open in the morning and in front of bank.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,200
There is a queue and the if.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:14,540
If the queue is empty, OK, and time is greater than six p.m., then we will close the bank.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,880
Otherwise, what we will do, we will try to extract customers from the queue.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,150
OK?

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:29,600
So if there are people which are standing in the queue, we will try to extract the customers OK from

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,990
the queue.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,330
Now, if the bank is open.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:40,970
So suppose you come here and the bank is open and there can be two possibilities either the queue is

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,090
empty on the queue is not empty.

24
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,510
That means during the time that the bank is open.

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,680
OK, so we are coming here when time is less than six.

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,090
And now if the queue is empty, then we will again go and check whether there are certain people that

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,320
have entered the queue or not.

28
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,840
If it is not the case, then we will extract a customer from the queue.

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,270
So in the later on, when you will learn some more concepts about programming, you will learn about

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,210
data centers, OK?

31
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,240
The researchers are nothing, but they are the containers that store data.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,860
So you is actually your data sector.

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,410
So we are performing an operation that if the queue is empty or not, if there is a person here, if

34
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,850
there is a person here that is a person, it these people, ABC, they are waiting in the queue to get

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,880
their work done and the bank will remove the ghost mode, which is dead at the front of the queue.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,100
Our next step would be to read the request of this person.

37
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,290
We will ask this person, What do you want to do?

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,710
That is denoted using this box read request.

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,580
Now, once you have read the request, you have to make a decision which content this person will give.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,970
So there are, let's say, four different counters.

41
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,830
One as A1 is B, one is C, one is D, which processed these requests.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,240
OK, so first we will check is this request for a demand draft?

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
If we did, yes, we send this customer to country.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,900
If it is not, we check if it is a request for direct deposit.

45
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,160
If yes, we send this person to counter, we if not, we send this person to counter-sued and we check

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,070
if it is for cash withdrawal.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,700
If yes, we send this to counter C, otherwise we take it for this guy's deposit.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,990
We send it to we.

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,870
If it is something else, OK, so maybe we have a miscellaneous helpline Gonder.

50
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,310
So we send this person to that country.

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,620
OK, this is how the various requests of these persons would be processed.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,490
Now you may have separate flowchart for each of these actions.

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,860
OK, so maybe there could be a flowchart starting from me.

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,200
OK, this is how you process the demand graph.

55
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:03,920
So humans OK, it is a flowchart read demand draft OK, and there may be some process to create a demand

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,220
draft.

57
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,360
OK, or something like that.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,610
Credit or debit demand, whatever you want to do, and then maybe end or hand it over to the customer,

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,560
whatever it could be.

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
So there can be separate flowchart for a busy, endless what you can do.

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,590
So sometimes in a problem, the flowchart can get quite big.

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,930
So in that case, you be the other part of the flowchart like we are doing in this case, starting from

63
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,340
E, it'll be exit.

64
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,670
OK, well, we exit all, be connected to some other point.

65
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,160
So what we are doing is we're making these circles, so these circles are known as connectors.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,110
Look, they are known as the nucleus, so they're combining two different products.

67
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,210
And there can be separate flowchart for ABC, and so.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:01,870
But now we have to understand that this would be a high level overview of our flowchart for a bank employee,

69
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,420
it would look like, OK, it's a bank employee would wait for customers in the queue that you would

70
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,270
be dead if the bank is open.

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,320
And for that, that is certain time.

72
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,260
And yes, that's how a flowchart would look like.

73
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,910
I hope you understood this flowchart on that side for this video.
