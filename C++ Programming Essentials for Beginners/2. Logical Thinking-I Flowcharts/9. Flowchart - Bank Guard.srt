00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,840
OK, here is a quick thinking problem for you, so you have to draw a flowchart for a bank security

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,120
guard.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,420
OK, so the bank security guard is going to wait for the customers outside the bank.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,670
And if they're coming before 6:00 p.m., it will add the customers to the queue.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,460
Otherwise, it will keep on waiting.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,750
And if time reaches six p.m., he is going to close the bank.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,980
OK, so this was this video and think how you are going to build this flow chart?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,200
OK?

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,220
Now let's talk about the solution.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,530
The solution would look something like this.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,820
The bank is open.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,510
And the security guard is going to take every dime, is it 6pm or not, if it's six p.m.?

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,510
If the answer is yes, he is going to close the bank if it is not.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,710
He's going to check whether there is a customer waiting outside the bank.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,430
If yes, is going to add the customer to the queue.

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,900
OK, so this is how it goes, like at the customer to the queue.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,100
And that's that's the work of the security guard.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,120
OK, if you are not worried, what will happen to the customer?

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,370
That is a part of a separate flow given to enters the bank.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,310
So then, after doing both the steps where the customer is waiting or not, he will.

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,920
He will continuously check when to close the bank.

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,340
So he's always looking at his watch.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,340
What is their time if there is a customer added to the queue?

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,120
Look at the time.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,110
If it is, if no customer is waiting again, look at what is their time will give.

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,250
So he's doing these two steps repeatedly.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,050
OK, so this part is inside a loop continuously.

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,800
Look at the time.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,750
And if there is a customer in time added to the queue, if there is not a customer, look at the time,

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,010
OK?

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,180
So in both the cases, after adding to the customer, he looked at time on other ways as well.

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,830
And as soon as time reaches six p.m., he is going to close the bank.

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,760
That's all.

34
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,210
That's a pretty simple flowchart of a security guard of a bank.

35
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,280
I hope you understood this one as well.
