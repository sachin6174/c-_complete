1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,820
I assume now we will try out another problem.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,350
The problem is given a number we want to check if it is a prime number or not.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,890
Let us quickly recap what is the prime number to?

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,140
A prime number is a number that has only two dividers, one and the number itself, OK?

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,950
If you're given and and it has only two dividers, one and the number itself, then it is a prime number.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,620
Few examples of prime numbers.

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:33,430
For example, seven to only one in seven divide seven the number 11, only one and 11 divide the number

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,820
11.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,990
Or talk about the number like 13, only one and 13.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,250
Divide this number.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,680
So only one end to divide.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,180
So all of them.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,040
Numbers are prime numbers.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,860
So what is a non prime number, so a non prime number will have at least one device it in the range

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,330
to do and minus one?

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,840
OK.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,370
At least one device that in the range.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,850
To do and minus one.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,560
So why do two and minus one, because you have seen that one and then divide all the numbers, they

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,580
divide prime numbers.

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,440
They also divide non-prime numbers.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:22,720
But if you have, at least one divides it in this range, starting from two up to n minus one.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,080
OK.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,910
If you find at least one it here, then you can see that this number is a non prime number.

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,440
OK, this number is a non brand.

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:41,290
For example, the number nine, so it has a divisor in the range to do it and the divide that history,

27
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,030
the three divides nine.

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,010
So you get to nine Model three.

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,450
This is zero.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,290
And.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,080
Nine is a non prime number.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,240
Talk about the number 14.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,500
So two divides.

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,060
14.

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,930
And this is not brain, OK?

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,710
Seven also divides 14, but we need to find only at least one device that will get one device that is

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,700
sufficient to prove the number is not brain.

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,390
Now, given a number, we need to check if it is prime or not.

39
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,210
Can we come up with a very simple logic?

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,070
Approval a no is prime or not.

41
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:30,050
Yes, logic would be that we can try to find out divisor in the range to do and minus one phone, find

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,530
out or devise it in the range.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,820
It will do and minus one, if the device that is found, if you are able to get a device it.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Then, yes, the number is not prime.

45
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,960
OK.

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,020
And if the device that is not found.

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,680
Then you can set the numbers right.

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,590
OK.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,990
This is how simple it is to prove a number is primal, not knowing what you can do is you can take a

50
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,420
pause and try to think of a flowchart approval numbers game or not.

51
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,490
OK, so let us try.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,200
The first step, as we discussed, would be a start.

53
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:23,890
Then we will try to read the value of the number that we want to prove as prime or not will read the

54
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,640
value of an.

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,870
The next step would be what?

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,590
We need to.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,990
Find advisor in the range to do and minus one, OK?

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,800
That means we will need a loop in this range.

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,290
It will do and minus one.

60
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,580
Let us take.

61
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,660
I'm currently at the no I initialize my eyes to.

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,070
I will.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,430
OK, I used to.

64
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,080
And now what I will do, I trade buildings I as less than equal to minus one.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,720
This is my stopping point of life.

66
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,060
I will take if I is less than equal to and minus one.

67
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,850
So this will go inside diamond at because it's a condition.

68
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,500
If it is less than equal, then minus one, OK?

69
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,390
If the case is yes or if the case is no, OK, we'll see what will happen in each of these cases if

70
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,190
it's less than equal one minus one.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,340
Then what we will do will try to divide and with I and find out the remainder.

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,600
We will check will give and is divisible by alternate will again put in either condition and that if

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,970
conditions, if I is if modulus I.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,130
If this is equal to zero.

75
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,370
Now again, two things can happen, Don, that again, we know or the answer can be yes.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:03,600
OK, now, if the answer is yes, what we can do, we can simply say that this number is a prime number.

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,050
OK?

78
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,470
This number is is not the prime number because, for example, talk about the number nine and you reach

79
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,550
three to nine.

80
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,780
Model three is zero.

81
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:20,670
And hence, you can see that this number is not prime, so you can print that this is a not prime number.

82
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,960
And Jordan.

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,390
You're done at this point.

84
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,240
OK, so what are you going to do?

85
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,160
You're going straight, go to exit.

86
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,520
You can safely exit the program from this particular point.

87
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,190
But what if, if it is not OK, if it is no, then what you're going to do?

88
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,260
So you are going to say, don't let it.

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,140
It might be possible that the end is not divisible by two.

90
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,080
It might be divisible by three.

91
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,220
So you are going to take it to the next place.

92
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,390
We are doing this.

93
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,680
OK?

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,600
Let us increment is a plus one.

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,000
And now what we are doing, we are again going to connect back here.

96
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,660
OK.

97
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,100
Again, we are going to connect back here again.

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,650
We will go to the next day.

99
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,620
We will check if that is less than equal to and minus one.

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,820
If it is yes, if it is divisible print, not prime.

101
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,750
Otherwise, we increment day and we again do the same thing again.

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,030
OK?

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,710
Now finally, if you come out of this direction, OK?

104
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,580
So in what case you will come out of this?

105
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,230
No direction, OK?

106
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,100
So can you think?

107
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,480
In what NATO, you will come out of it, the only scenario in which you will come out of from this blog

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,110
is via this error is when you do not exit the loop through inside this direction, OK?

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:56,410
That means we could not find a device that in the range to do and minus one that could divide and and

110
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:04,530
hence from here you can say OK, if it is, if I has reached this value, you can simply say print name.

111
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,130
And then you can simply do exit, OK?

112
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,540
Or you can connect to the same exit here.

113
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,800
Not an issue.

114
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,740
Now let us try to brighten this flow chart for value of any call to seven.

115
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:27,060
OK, let's see what happens for an equal to seven eyes, to the words less than equal to six or two

116
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,290
is less than equal to six.

117
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,320
Is seven divisible by two than it is?

118
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,620
No.

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,800
So you increment right?

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,250
So the eye becomes three.

121
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,700
OK, the eye becomes three.

122
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,060
Three is less than equal to six.

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,640
Is seven divisible by three boundaries?

124
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,910
No.

125
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,990
So you again come here are equal to eight plus one.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,210
You again go back here, OK, via this route.

127
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,020
So I is known for the Xenical.

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,510
Six seven is not divisible by four.

129
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,250
It becomes five.

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,780
Five is less than equal to six.

131
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,580
Seven is not divisible by five.

132
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,810
Again, no.

133
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,810
You come here and it becomes six.

134
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,310
Texas, less than equal to six seven, is not divisible by six.

135
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,510
And that is no.

136
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,420
And the value of, I know becomes seven.

137
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,840
So when you when you now come here, OK, so I is seven, which is not less than equal than minus one.

138
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,920
Hence, you come out of this brand and you print that it is a premium, but hence you say, OK, the

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,230
number seven is a prime number.

140
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,620
OK.

141
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,260
And then we exit, so it would have been some of the no like nine.

142
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,020
So you would have been OK.

143
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,030
There was less than equal to eight, but nine is not divisible by two.

144
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,060
Make it three trees less than equal to eight and nine more, three is zero.

145
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,770
You come here.

146
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,780
Then you hit a yes, your brain does not break and then you exert.

147
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,390
Then guess of nine, you will print that this number is not plain, OK?

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,730
So I hope this flowchart is now clear to you and your understood how we have implemented a loop.

149
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,990
OK, so what barred from the loop this box?

150
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,250
Is the starting point of the new book, if this is just a condition inside the loop?

151
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,590
This is just a condition inside a loop.

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:20,940
OK?

153
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,160
This part is the starting point of the loop, which has this stopping criteria.

154
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,570
Here we have the update condition, and this part is the work then.

155
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:30,960
OK.

156
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,460
So that's all for this video, I hope you understood the concept.

157
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,300
Thank you.
