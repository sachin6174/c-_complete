00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,090
So in this lecture, we are going to discuss this problem, given three numbers, we have to find the

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,590
largest of them, OK?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,610
For example, we have a number 10, we have a number 30 and we have a number 22.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,730
Obviously, we know the largest in this case is the middle man.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,830
This is the largest number because we have to print the largest of the three numbers.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,570
Another example would be, let's say we have 12 eight to 10.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,770
In this case, the largest is the number 12.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,900
So let's see how we can draw a flowchart to find the largest of these numbers.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,640
The first step, as we're discussing every problem, would be a start.

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,020
The next step would be to read the values of these three numbers.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,850
OK, whatever it is, the input, we are going to read it, for example, into the input as.

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:01:00,520
Then, well, I need this input would be fed to the system by using a read statement, OK, in the next

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,880
step.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,160
That would be a comparison to what we can do.

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:11,230
We can check if it is greater than equal to be and is greater than equal to see if this is.

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,000
If this condition is true, that means we are checking is then greater than both.

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,510
12.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,610
And it is also greater than equal to it.

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,980
Obviously, this condition is not true.

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:30,280
But if this is true to what we can do, we can simply print and exit.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,290
That means our work gets done.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,610
So we can say in this case, if it is like 12, then indeed we know that 12 is greater than or equal

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,150
to 10 and 12 is also greater than or equal to eight.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,770
OK.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,870
So in this case, we will separate eight and end or exit whatever it is.

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,590
But if it is not the case, what does it mean, OK?

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,640
So this basically means, let's say the numbers are 10, 12 and eight, so is clearly not an option.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,150
It cannot be on it.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,700
So what we will do, we will take for be gone.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,140
We believe it answered.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,650
In order to have real as ever answered what we can do, we can check that if B is greater than or equal

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,590
to A and B is greater than or equal to C, OK.

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,200
This is the case.

34
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,700
If we go into this direction of yours begins OK.

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:32,200
B is the answer identifies if it is not the greatest B is not the greatest, then B must be the greatest.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,440
OK?

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,100
So in this case, we will say print c and exit.

38
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:45,220
OK, now you may ask why I'm using this greater than equal to sign why not only greater than is sufficient.

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,450
OK, let's see.

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,240
The numbers are equal.

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,470
For example, let's say the numbers are.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,060
Twenty.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,420
Twenty twenty and.

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,890
It's been OK.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,080
If this is the case, though, if you only use the statement greater than, OK, so for 2020 and then

46
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:17,700
obviously this condition would be false when there is not greater than 20, this condition would also

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,300
be false.

48
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,290
B is not greater than what would happen in this case.

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:29,700
We will end up in the last branch of the code and we will separate the two, which which will output

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,690
bend in this case.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,770
So which is wrong?

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,580
That is why in this flowchart, we are writing a modification that while making this check, we are

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,750
checking whether the number is greater than or equal to.

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
So this symbol is known as greater than or equal to.

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,390
So if 20 is greater than equal to 20, the answer would be yes.

56
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:56,190
So if the numbers are like 2020 and then so what you will do in the first check you will check is 20

57
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,440
greater than equal to 20 yes, and 20 is greater than or equal to 10.

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,850
Yes, we will print a and you will.

59
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,950
And in this case, your output would be this number 20.

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,990
I hope you have understood the flowchart to find out the largest of three numbers, and that's all for

61
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,560
this we do.
