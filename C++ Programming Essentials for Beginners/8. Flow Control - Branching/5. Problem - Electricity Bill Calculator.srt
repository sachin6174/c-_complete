1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,650
I was in this lecture hall when the electricity bill calculator.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,250
So what is given we are given the total consumption of household and units, and we want to write a

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,910
program to estimate the total amount as by the following table.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:23,970
OK, so this table basically tells us what is the rate of electricity for certain consumption in terms

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,780
of number of units?

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:33,660
So if someone consumes one 200 units, then he's not going to pay anything, so the bill would be Robbinsville.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,050
OK?

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,640
If someone consumes from 100 to 200 units, then for each unit that is consumed in this range.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,740
That it would be number of units that you have going to jump into five rate the number of units which

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,880
are greater than 100.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,980
Of course it every day 100 units.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,690
And if someone consumes from 200 or 300 units, it is so bad that basically these are the difference

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,910
that as you're going to do more electricity, your by unit rate is going to be higher, which is going

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,670
to be in this range because every unit that is consumed in this range, it is 10 rupees per unit because

15
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,070
whatever the number of units you're going to do, for example, you're going to undo 50 units.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,330
So you're consuming 53 units, which are in this range, 200 or 300.

17
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,380
They will be charged art and rupees per unit.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,310
So that would be multiplied with two.

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,580
And anything that is beyond 300 units, it would be charged the rate of electricity.

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,940
Let me just clarify this problem.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,710
So the slabs at five, 10, 12 and.

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,510
Let me show you something.

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:57,070
So from zero to 100, it is zero, but 100 to 200 it is five, then 200 or 300 it is 10 and 300 plus

24
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,600
it is 12 is OK.

25
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:07,150
This is the unit cost of, I suppose, someone consumes 280 units of electricity.

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,020
OK, now how is going to be so from zero to 100 units?

27
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,010
He is not going to pay anything from 100 to 200.

28
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
How many units you have consumed?

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,440
So of course, he has consumed 100 units.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,370
It is willing to pay 100 multiplied with the slab rate this loud, it is five billion to be ordered

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,950
into five from 200 to 300.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,810
There it is 10.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,410
But he is only consuming up to 288, so that means that he is consuming 80 units.

34
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,000
These are the units will be charged at Rupees 10 to Darden's 18.

35
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,840
So the answer would be 500 plus 800.

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,240
So he will be charged rupees 300 for consuming 280 took.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,560
OK, this is example one.

38
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,410
So let me take you another example.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,480
It is on one charges 300 450 units.

40
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,390
So again, zero 200, it is zero 100 to 200, which is hundred units.

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,960
So it would be handed into five, 200 or 300.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,890
OK.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,410
It is, again, Joe.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,250
We are going to charge 400 units at the rate of rupees 10, which is like thousand rupees and what 300

45
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,700
what we have.

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,530
We have only 50 units.

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,250
These 50 units will be charged rupees by unit.

48
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,520
So it is 500 plus 1000 plus 600, OK.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
So this comes out of group is 21.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,060
So that would be the total bill of the person.

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:45,760
So given an input, the number of units we want to output, what is the total bill that would be generated

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,590
for that particular person?

53
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,580
Now it's your time.

54
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,810
Pull this video and try to think how you can hold this up, OK, how you can build this algorithm that

55
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,650
will work like this.

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,620
Alright, so I hope you have given a talk.

57
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,740
Now I'm going to show you the implementation.

58
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,130
OK?

59
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:10,240
So I'm simply going to use the conditional statements to decide in which category the person is lying

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,770
and will generate a formula for each of each of the particular categories.

61
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,010
OK?

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,860
So maybe I can go ahead.

63
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,450
So first thing is, I need to store the number of units, so I'll create a bucket.

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:31,830
I will declare a bucket, which I will take as input from the user, and I will try to generate a formula

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,980
that OK, if the number of units is less than equal to 200, then how much would should be my cost?

66
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,370
Maybe I can create a bucket called cost, which is let's not defined.

67
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,700
And if your unit is less than equal 200, the cost is also legal.

68
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,300
OK.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,020
As if if this condition is not true, I can put if units is less than equal to 200.

70
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:05,230
Now look, if we are not putting a condition that if units is greater than equal, 200 and units is

71
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,300
less than equal to 200, OK.

72
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,400
So I don't need this and is ready like this in business.

73
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,880
I don't need to write this condition because if I am coming here right, then your needs must be greater

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,450
than 100.

75
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,680
Because I've used as if and if units were less than 100, then we could have easily stopped this if

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,210
that means if I'm coming.

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,600
The units are greater than 100 and I am only taking this condition if they are less than equal 200 so

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,910
that as if condition by building as a block, it simplifies of a condition.

79
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,150
OK?

80
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,480
We don't need to write additional check because if you are coming at, that automatically means that

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,310
this block was not true and only then we are landing up here.

82
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,730
OK, so I'm just going to avoid this check.

83
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,010
And what would be the cost?

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,320
OK, now let me give an example.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,530
Let's say someone is consuming 170 units, which is less than 200 from zero to 100.

86
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,630
He would be charged to deal with 100 to 120.

87
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,270
He is going to pay for the 70 units, OK?

88
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,790
Basically, this is what the unit is.

89
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,720
So you have to subtract units minus hundred and you have to multiply with the slab rate, which is five.

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,920
OK, so we are going to say the cost is zero for up to 100 units on four additional units.

91
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,440
It is.

92
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,560
The units minus 100 into the slab cost.

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
The cost is five.

94
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,900
That's it.

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
That computes our cost.

96
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,580
Otherwise, if units is less than equal to three.

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,830
OK, so the ending, I do not need to check if they are greater than 200.

98
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,820
It automatically means overcoming it.

99
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,060
They're greater than 200, OK, otherwise we would have entered this as a block.

100
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,380
So now the cost would be for up 200 units.

101
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,550
It is going to be zero from under two 200 units.

102
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,250
How how much we have already consumed.

103
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,820
So this bag would always be 100 or get.

104
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,730
That means there is a fixed cost of a unit that is unloaded, multiplied with the slab that is five.

105
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,860
Now we know that we're somewhere in the middle of 200 or 300 later.

106
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,180
This is what the unit is.

107
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,130
So how many units are these?

108
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:29,230
These are nothing but units minus 200 000 plus units minus 200 multiplied by the slab rate.

109
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,370
The Slabbert is done.

110
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,710
OK, that computer cost.

111
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,780
Otherwise, we know that we have consumed more than 300 units.

112
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,990
And in that case, again, we'll up 200 units for the next hundred units.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,090
It is five for next 200.

114
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,170
Units like up to 300 are destined for anything beyond.

115
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,670
It is 12 rupees, 12 rupees, but unit eight.

116
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:04,810
So now we have it cost is zero 430, up 200 units, then from 201 to 200, right?

117
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,730
It is our units multiplied with five from 200 to 300.

118
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,820
It is again 100 units multiplied with 10.

119
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,380
And anything that is beyond 300.

120
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,220
How many units.

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
So units minus three hundred OK.

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,150
Multiplied with 12.

123
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,140
Because this is this is going to the formula for anything that is beyond look as if it is not clear.

124
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,820
I can just explain this part again, this part because it includes everything, right?

125
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,160
So zero, 200, 100 or 200, 200 300.

126
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,260
Maybe somebody is consuming 800 units.

127
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,440
OK, so now for zero two hundred, we have already ordered zero done, but 100 to 200.

128
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,660
This will all discharged are to be safe.

129
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,160
So these are under units, OK?

130
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,530
From one zero one zero zero 200 from two zero one to 300, it is again 10 rupees per unit, so 100 multiplied

131
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,980
with five hundred multiplied with 10.

132
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,800
And from 318.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,140
How many units are these?

134
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,680
So units minus 300.

135
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,960
OK, so this data is 500 multiplied with 12.

136
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,320
So this is actually going to add up and this is going to give us the final answer so we can see out

137
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,950
the final cost that is this much.

138
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:32,110
Now let us try to renovate code and I can say da large electricity bill and I give OK to it the units.

139
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,510
Thirteen hundred great.

140
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,880
This is what we computed 350 units.

141
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,200
Oh sorry, 350 units.

142
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,530
Do we get 20 100?

143
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,350
This is what we computed, OK, and maybe 800 units.

144
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,900
And the answer is 75 500, which seems good.

145
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,190
OK?

146
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:59,320
So that's all for this video and you can see an example of using as if these reason may be used as if

147
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,900
because only one of the number of units will only fall in one of these categories.

148
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,660
Okay, so they cannot fall in to three different categories.

149
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,780
The answer would depend upon whether the units the final units end up.

150
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,340
OK, so that's all for this video.

151
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,900
Thank you.
