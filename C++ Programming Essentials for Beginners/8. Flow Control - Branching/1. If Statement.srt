00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello, everyone's in this lecture, we're going to talk about conditional statements, so conditional

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,050
statements are required when you want to execute some code based on a certain condition, OK?

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,760
For example, you want to go out and you want to dig in.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:22,620
And if the weather is rainy or you want to go out and you want to dig sunglasses if the weather is a

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,100
sunny day.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,490
The best ones are environment variables.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,620
You want to do some actions, OK?

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,010
So for that, in every programming language, we have a concept of a if block.

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,430
OK.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,270
So what we are going to do, we are going to say OK will define our condition that evaluates the bullet.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,800
For example, we said, OK, the marks is 90, and if Marks is greater than 80, then we will do some

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,040
work.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,820
We will print, let's party.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,810
We having to do a bite if we get more than 80 marks.

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,300
So this is a condition that evaluates tubulin.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:06,120
OK, so this is an expression that gives gives us the value to it can also give false.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,500
So if it gives false, then the corresponding block of code, OK, this block of code, this will not

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,460
get executed, OK?

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,330
So you can have one or more lines inside the f block.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,880
So let me show you in a good night how you're going to execute this code.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:32,490
So maybe what I can do, I can see ink marks and I will take input the marks from the user and if marks

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,480
greater than 80.

23
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,790
OK, so I will print.

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,480
Let's party and see out.

25
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,180
Yeah, something like that.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,190
So we are actually executing two lines of code, right?

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,650
So, OK, that's very good.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,800
I let it out as well.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,180
So I can say da slash if demo.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
So it is waiting for the input.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,520
I can say, OK, I got 92 marks, so it says, let's party on you now.

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,800
One more thing I want to inform you here.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:18,240
If you have if you don't want to put this block, then this gold will still get compiled on a vote on

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,690
this code.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,240
And if I get something like 70 now, you can see you're getting the output right.

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,520
So what actually happens?

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,130
What happens if you don't put curly brackets?

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,460
So basically, what happens if you don't put curly brackets?

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,180
So by default, one line of code, it is included with the f block.

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:46,020
OK, so if you don't put curly brackets, then this statement is assumed to be inside the block and

41
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,630
anything that is written outside it.

42
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,320
OK.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,540
That is the second line or the third line.

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,290
It is assumed that it is outside the f block.

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,180
OK, so this line will always get executed.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,150
What we saw is when we give a value of marks, that is 70, the second line of code always got executed.

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,400
OK, so this code or if you have more lines of code code always executed both these lines?

48
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,220
Yeah, and always executed this output.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:25,470
You will always get printed irrespective of what is inside your inside the f block like arms so you

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:25,800
can keep.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,050
These two lines are always getting executed.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,600
So that means if you have.

53
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,690
A work that is a single instrument statement inside the block, you can skip working locally brackets,

54
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,730
but I would still recommend you do in these brackets because they are more clarity.

55
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,350
You get what you are trying to do inside the f block.

56
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,510
That's about half block in the next video I will teach you about the block.
