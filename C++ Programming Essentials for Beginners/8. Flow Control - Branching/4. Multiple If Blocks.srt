1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,560
I it's one common thing that people mistake while working with defense, they sometimes try to use multiple

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,210
lift blocks.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:17,500
OK, so I'll give you an example of multiple, if so, for example, in the code that we have written

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,210
down.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,660
Suppose you forget to use Eldred and you end up using the if blog every year to do this or it is correct

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,310
and it will compile.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,820
But it is not logically because I will explain away.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,070
Now what I replaced as if blog.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,020
If blog.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,010
And now if I go and try to learn this code and let's run it.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:50,180
So now suppose I give again the same input 72 and OK, it is giving me.

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,300
The answer, OK?

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,100
We are running the wrong fight, so the file name is multiple live demo, so we should not large multiple

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:09,740
if demo and now if I give 72 as input for 72 marks and actually getting two great great be on Grade

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,070
C.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
Well, that is not expected.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,650
Now let us try to analyze why this is happening.

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,890
OK, so when you write multiple statements did not the part of the same floor, OK, each block is treated

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,760
independently.

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,900
So now this block is independent.

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,410
The second is block, this is independent.

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,330
The third block, this is independent, this is actually combined with the last insider.

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:44,620
Now, if you give something like 82, then this block would be checked and it will get executed.

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,190
This blog again would be checked because it is independent.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,050
It will also get executed.

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,310
And talking about this, so again, in this case, the last health is combined with the if statement

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,810
is cannot come alone.

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,050
It has to get combined with the if block.

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,570
So this is combined with this block and hence out of these two, which is going to get executed, if

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,990
not because you have Mox, which is greater than.

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,250
So you're going to get great.

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,020
Great, great.

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,480
Be great.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,490
But you you always wanted to give only one grade.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,910
So that means when you use get involves executing one of the blogs go with the if as it structure.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,250
But if you have to do something like two different conditions, it's okay.

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,280
So I will give you an example, OK?

38
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:42,790
I include I stream using namespace as study and main return zero.

39
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,590
And maybe I can give you an example there are multiple, if would make sense.

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,240
OK, maybe you're doing two different things.

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,130
Of you, your taking.

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,960
Um, how is the weather OK?

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,730
And maybe depending on the value of that, you want to do something so maybe I can sync with it.

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,660
And it is one so you can check if there is one.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,080
OK, so this is also treated as a.

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,400
Do statement, because anything that is non-zero, it is treated as true, so again, it's okay if weather

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,980
is, why not, if that is non-zero, right?

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:32,150
Maybe I want to enjoy the debate and maybe the second condition is based, one marks.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:41,300
So if any marks equals two 90 and same if marks greater than 80, maybe I want to do something like,

50
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,460
let's celebrate the result, something like this.

51
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,790
In this case, there are two off blocks and they are independent, OK?

52
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,470
So there is no relation of the statement to whether the vid mocks.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,960
Both of them can be true at the same time.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,090
OK, so now if I build this school and if I show you the output, if I see multiple if.

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,020
OK.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,060
So we are getting this thing, enjoy today, and let's celebrate the.

57
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,260
So in this case, it's okay to have two different if conditions getting executed at the same time.

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,800
OK.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,460
But in the previous case, it was not OK to have multiple blades being assigned to the same person.

60
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:51,150
So I hope now you have understood the difference between using a as this blog versus using multiple

61
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,890
blocks, OK?

62
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,910
And yet all of them that part of the same view, only one of them will get executed where the first

63
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:06,920
condition is true, whereas in the other case, each block is checked independently, irrespective of

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,800
the previous block was true, or it was false.

65
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,260
OK, so that is the main difference.

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,350
And that is the point that people do make a lot of mistakes, but I hope now you will remember this

67
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,890
difference.
