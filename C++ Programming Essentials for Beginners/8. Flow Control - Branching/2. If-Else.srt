00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:07,800
Everyone, so we have already seen how to write a blog on how to write conditional gold using give,

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,330
so if we also have something which is known as if as blog, OK, now suppose your condition is not true

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,160
and you want to execute something when the condition is false.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,430
So that is the L block comes into the OK.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,730
So what we have seen in this index, you if followed by a condition followed by a block of code, you

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,190
write one or more lines.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,900
And if the condition is true, the block will get executed.

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,830
But suppose if the condition is false and you want to do something only when the condition is OK, so

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,030
you can put as block.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,640
So maybe either you want to, but let's party if you get more than 80 marks, and if you don't get more

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,080
than 80 marks, maybe you want to print it, work out next time.

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,070
OK, so this can be easily done using an inverse block.

13
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,320
So let me show you in the code as well.

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,840
So maybe I can say is work hard next time?

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,860
OK, L's work hard next time.

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,030
Now, one thing to remember is that as we do not give any condition OK, so as cannot be used independently.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,650
So if we can see that if Block can be written independently without writing the S block, but the ALS

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,710
block itself cannot be independent, it has to glove with the last f block, so it will get connected

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,660
with the last f block.

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,050
OK.

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,480
And there is no condition that you will specify in the S block, so it basically it gets executed when

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,650
this condition is false.

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,280
OK, when this condition gets voids, the control flow will come into this line and it will execute

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,880
everything that is written inside the ALS box.

25
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,560
Let us run this code and maybe put something in.

26
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,860
So this court has always executed irrespective of we are in the f block or we are inside this block,

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,330
we get into s block.

28
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,370
This code will always get executed.

29
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,050
So let me show you the output.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,590
So maybe I got 92 monks, so it seems let's party on the flow of control and the control flow jumped

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,350
to line number 17 because we executed line number 11.

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,250
We did not execute this block because this condition is false.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,940
This condition is true and this is this will not jump into the S block, so it will come here, OK?

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,080
And similarly, if I give something like 32.

35
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,840
So it will work hard next time and the code is always executed.

36
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,120
So this condition is not false.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,530
So we execute what is written in the block and we come here, OK?

38
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,140
So that is about the first block.

39
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,750
I hope you understood this concept.
