00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,260
Everyone in this lecture will talk about switchgear statement, the switch cases used when you have

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,380
to select one of the multiple blocks of code based upon a certain value and you need to execute that

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,080
block of code, OK, get will define us, which case in something like this, we have a switch, followed

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,710
by some expression that evaluates to a particular value.

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,020
So that value, let's say, is X or Y or something sums each of for each of the possibilities.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,800
We have defined the keys and in that case will write some bits of code that will get executed.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,040
OK?

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,180
So I'll show you with the help of a more real example.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,900
For example, let's say you're building something to print the days of the week later.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,600
If you input one, it should print Monday.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,170
OK, if your input do, it prints attitudes Tuesday or three.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,610
It prints Wednesday for Thursday and up to up to four seven four Sunday.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:06,450
What you're looking at your input is is a value and or seven values if you do it using if else you need

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,320
seven blocks of AFL to get that kind of stuff can be simplified a little using the Switch case block.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,340
And let me show you an example maybe I can to end today.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,930
I will take input today and I will put the switch.

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,530
I'll put the expression as the value of the day.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,290
OK, now I will have certain cases, for example, cases one, so one one would mean we are talking

19
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,950
about what what we want to do when the days when musically I want to print the money, OK?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,490
And in each case, it is important to have a break statement as well, right?

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,840
That break statement takes us out of the way to look like here, OK?

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,740
But if you don't break it, it is going to execute the next case.

23
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,140
I'm just going to show you an example.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,210
You have Monday, Tuesday.

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,340
Break, you have Wednesday, followed by a break.

26
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,290
We'll get to each statement end with a semicolon to the outage one statement.

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,510
Break is another statement, though you can have them in a single line as well, right?

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,690
So that is not the issue.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,350
A list core business, maybe three four times.

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,330
OK.

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,030
Three.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,580
Wednesday is Ford Thursday.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,660

34
5:00 is Friday.

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,810
And care exists.

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,160
Hmm.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,380
OK.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,760
And we also have a default case, OK, maybe you want to give something, or maybe it was it is not

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,590
giving something like 13.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,310
Maybe you can ask the user and a valid input.

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,350
And maybe we can have case seven for 10 days, but.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
And we go to break here.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,260
Now let me show you how this is going to work.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,700
Maybe see I can see end of Switch, but that's not required.

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,410
Let's build this code and let us try to run this one.

46
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,900
Maybe the days five.

47
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:33,180
So I get done today is Friday, OK, the day is, let's say, nine, so I get and provided input.

48
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,280
Now what is the meaning of the default case?

49
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,990
So it is going to execute when none of the case is going to match, OK?

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,740
And what is the significance of the brief statement?

51
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,220
I suppose if I don't put a brief statement at three and I don't put a brief statement out for, OK,

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,420
let us see what is going to happen if I give the input as, let's say, three.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,820
What?

54
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm going to do it.

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm going to get Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,160
That means.

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:08,110
All the cases below Wednesday that executed until you find a break statement to get the marching is

58
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,240
going to happen today is three, so it is going to look at OK, is it three?

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,930
Is is it redone?

60
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,280
There is no.

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Is it redone?

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,760
There is, yes.

63
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,590
And it is going to execute all blocks of code until it finds a big statement.

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,090
OK, so it stops here Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

65
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,730
That is why putting the brake statement is important in each block of code.

66
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,290
All right.

67
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,090
That's all for this video, and I hope you understood the Switch guest blog as well.
