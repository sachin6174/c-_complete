00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,450
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,900
So we have seen the blog.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,590
We have also seen the health blog in this video getting to see something known as a live blog.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,350
OK, so now you might require to write a code which behaves differently on different conditions, OK?

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:23,280
So basically, what we're going to do, we are going to define a new type of block that is as if we'll

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,270
get another.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,360
One thing I will tell you is if you're writing a f block, OK, then after each block, you can write

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,000
multiple live blogs.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,580
OK, you can have a live blog you can have in a live blog.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,260
You can have another live blog as many as you want, OK?

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,580
And finally, you can have as blog, which is again optional.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,700
If you want to do something in this blog, you can do otherwise.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,260
You can skip this blog.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,440
Know why this is useful.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,130
So when you have a structure like this, OK, and it basically executes the first blog where the condition

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,340
gets so you can do your writing or condition inside if blog.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,480
They're also writing organization ZAYDA as a blog, OK?

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,660
Now, for example, if you get 70 marks, so we know that this condition is not a total matter, not

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,380
greater than 80.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,390
So this will not get executed.

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,050
OK.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,560
So we come to the next blog and we get the deletions, which is much greater than sixty nine is yes.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,930
So this blog will get executed.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,290
OK.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,080
And if none of these conditions is true, then obviously that is and the blog that will get executed

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
if none of these conditions is traded.

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,700
So basically, if you have a blog intro like this where the first condition as far as the next as follows,

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,460
and I suppose this is right, let us assume that this is also true and this we don't care right now

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,750
what what is going to happen.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,100
It is not going to execute the two blogs, which it is only going to execute.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,730
The blog, which is forced to write the blog, which got forced right.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,490
So in this case, this is the blog which got first drew, then coming from top to bottom.

33
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,090
So only this blog is going to get executed.

34
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,740
OK, so that means in this call, if I had something like as if Mox greater than 50.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,790
And I thought, OK, great or something like that, dialogue will not get executed if they put this

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,610
block below this block below the edit.

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,550
Let me show you a --.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,050
And that would offer you more clarity.

39
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,560
OK, so let us jump into the code and show you the demo here.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,340
So what I'm going to do I have if Mark's greater than 70.

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,760
OK, maybe I can put some grades here.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,820
Let's party.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,290
We got greedy and sealed.

44
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,750
Maybe very.

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:06,150
I would grade B and as if it's a marks greater than 60.

46
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:18,720
And what I'm going to do, I'm saying, okay, see, okay, um, keep it up and I can do great.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,620
Let's see.

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,670
Now I've made this call, and I'm going to run it.

49
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,920
So let me show you.

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,770
Now I'm waiting for the marks, so I give something like, let's say, when do I get there, done grade

51
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,960
B and then this line of code is always executed.

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,940
So what is happening?

53
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,460
So marks 72, right?

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,150
And if I talk about this condition, this blog will not get executed because it is false.

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,750
And if I go on to the next block, which is this one?

56
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,420
Yes, I got 72 marks.

57
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,740
And this is true.

58
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,330
And this will get executed.

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,990
OK, now, although the below below this one, this block, right?

60
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:24,170
So this is also true, but it will not get executed because the only first elusive block in the gene

61
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,490
that will get executed, OK, I'm similarly this will not get executed.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,400
None of these conditions are going to get checked as well.

63
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,510
So nothing below the block where the condition is true, it is going to take longer to execute it.

64
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,470
OK, because now when you use as it blocks, all of them are connected.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,310
All of them are part of the same view.

66
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,270
So that means only one of them will get executed.

67
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,680
And once this block gets executed, nothing below these blocks, which is part of the same floor, will

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,750
get you will get executed, OK?

69
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,630
So that is why even you got the marks when you do this block of good will not get executed, although

70
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,770
this condition is true, but it is not going to get sick because we have already executed this final,

71
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,270
because that is what you need to remember about, as if only the first block where the condition becomes

72
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,450
true will get executed.

73
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,730
OK?

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,310
So that's it.

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,000
That's all for this video.
