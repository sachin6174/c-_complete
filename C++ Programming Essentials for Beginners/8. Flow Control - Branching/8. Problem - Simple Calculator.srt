00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,080
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,310
So in this video lecture, we rebuild a very simple calculator using which case, let's see how we can

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,580
do it.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,490
So the idea here is you will give him give us some input so it will give input in the form and in digit.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:21,680
Followed by an operator, which is going to be a character, for example, plus minus multiply or divide

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,230
up modulus on, followed by another integer, let's it later, this is it.

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,960
I would like to output 13 right in this.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,450
Now, the way you're going to do it, input, you're not going to give it like this, you're going to

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,690
give five plus five, followed by space, followed by operators, followed by space and followed by

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,140
three OK.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,870
We are going to read three different numbers.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,630
We want to take everything.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,530
Like, if you want to take everything without spaces, then you will have to create a strange object

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,360
to store it and you have to participate.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,820
But for now, just to simplify our work, we are going to take in, put a number and it would be a connected,

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,090
which we call as operator and maybe the number, let's indicate.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:18,480
So, operator, let's just call it as OPD so they can put a followed by the operator, followed by the

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,490
number B will put the operator inside the switch.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,510
Exploration and based on the value of this operator, we will do some work, so we will have a case

20
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,190
for less.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,610
So what will the old A-plus be and unbrick?

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
OK, if it is minus?

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,230
We will do see out a minus B and oil and break employed multiply.

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:57,740
Well, to see out a into B and and break, maybe another is modulus, you can handle the remaining cases

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,200
by yourself again to see out a more or less B and and and break.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,860
OK, and for something else, you're going to default.

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,800
Please enter a valid.

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,930
Operator.

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,340
So this message will be displayed to the user if he gives invalid input.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,620
So let's build it.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,410
And now let us try to underscore.

32
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,820
So we have dodged large.

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,970
Maybe I give five plus three.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
I get it.

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,650
Great.

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,930
Maybe I give 6:44.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,370
I get 42.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Great.

39
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,280
I give it minus three.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,300
Five.

41
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,780
OK.

42
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:54,870
On eight models, three two grades, it is working fine for the four cases that we have written.

43
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,660
And if I give nine divided by three, we have not handled this case.

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,690
So it gives us please enter a valid operator.

45
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,640
OK, so we could have done it using it felt also, but using which case made the code more cleaner,

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,770
cleaner and easier to write as well?

47
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,010
OK.

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,780
That's all for this video.

49
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,320
Thank you.
