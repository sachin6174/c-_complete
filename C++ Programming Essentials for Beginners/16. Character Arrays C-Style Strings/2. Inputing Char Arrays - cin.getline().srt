1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,340
Everyone will know we were working with corrected errors on what we saw is that while creating that

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,220
it, we were initializing that will give it some value.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,620
But this might not be the case.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,220
Always.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,570
Many are what you might need to do is you and you just need to define and edit and you want to read

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,700
user input, OK, you want to read user input, what you can do in that case.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,600
So one ways you can see some guy and maybe some greetings ended, and maybe you can see this sentence

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,250
can contain up to and regulators, including the null character and I can design greeting.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,760
OK, so now what I'm trying to tell you is if you talk about the integer that you have to read each

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,720
of the inputs using a loop, OK, which still can be the word will be corrected, but scene does work.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,410
It will accept the entire world as an input and it will store it in the correct.

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:07,980
OK.

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,800
Let me show you and the output as well, right?

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,090
You're going to see out outward.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,340
All right.

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,280
Sorry, Scott, greeting.

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,820
Now what we are doing, we are waiting for some input, maybe.

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,570
Hello.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,160
It says hello, followed by name which was actually getting printed because of the state.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,450
You can directly print the name without using a loop.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,380
And you can directly input.

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,160
A list of characters and get it stored inside, Oh, Eddie.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,510
OK, now when you're storing this inside an area, it is automatically null terminated, OK, because

24
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:05,430
C knows that the correct way of storing inside look at Eddie is to terminate that area with the null

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,700
correct.

26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,460
So this work, the scene object is going to do for you.

27
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,730
OK, so it happens internally.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,470
You don't do any work, right?

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,750
Directly input a list of characters and it gets stored inside automatically.

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,270
Let me try to experiment with some more input and we'll see something.

31
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,050
So we are running, let's say hello, and I do get the output.

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,400
Which is hello itself.

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,100
Well, let me input a sentence.

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,860
Hello, how are you doing?

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,100
Now, what is happening in this case, so although we are inputting a sentence.

36
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,680
It is only taking the first word, OK.

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:59,020
It is only taking the first word of why this is happening, OK, fingers season will stop processing

38
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:07,150
and put when it sees a whitespace, it sees a white space and whatever what it is going to do.

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,150
So I suppose zen Buddhist hello, followed by space.

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,040
Somehow, I might.

41
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,590
What it is doing, it is copying everything inside the Eddy.

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:25,210
And as soon as it takes a whitespace, it puts a nail in the output that ended terminated.

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,230
It puts the box under in your daddy.

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,970
OK, so degrading it is terminated at this point.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,030
And when you're printing this eddy, you only get the output.

46
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,480
That is it.

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,760
And how do we fix this problem?

48
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,150
We need a function that inputs entire engines and stored it incorrectly.

49
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,450
OK.

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:58,030
So the function that does that is not it is known as Good Line or get some great line as a method.

51
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,180
And this great mattered, except two things.

52
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,270
One is it needs this in object, so we both seen to this method.

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,250
And second is it needs the connectivity where you need to stored something.

54
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,550
So the character that is your greeting.

55
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,240
OK.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,380
Now, let us try to build a school.

57
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,170
OK, sorry to interrupt.

58
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:34,690
This is not the lend function that is a function called as seen not on it, except the name of the dairy

59
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,070
that is greeting.

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,900
And it also should know what is the maximum size of dairy so that it can load up to that maximum size.

61
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,450
And remember everything that is going beyond that size because of the maximum sizes.

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,510
Hundred.

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,200
And now we can run this code, it is getting built.

64
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,470
OK, standard guidelines.

65
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,060
It's a method of the thin object.

66
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,140
OK.

67
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,760
And we are calling this method and it is accepting the name of dairy, followed by the length of dairy,

68
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,860
the maximum size of dairy.

69
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,190
And now we can run this code on again.

70
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,670
OK.

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,460
Hello, how are you?

72
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:25,240
Now you can see this output is getting stored as it is right, and that is what seemed to get lenders

73
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:31,690
as so what I'm trying to tell you is just to summarize what we have learned to use scene.

74
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:44,020
If you want to read a word that means no spaces and use a not great line if you want to read a sentence.

75
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,800
That means including spaces.

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,580
OK.

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,990
And one more thing I would like to tell you, suppose you don't want to read till the end of the line,

78
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,070
maybe you want to read a paragraph which maybe terminates at a DOD, OK, which might terminate at a

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,430
dot?

80
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,570
What are you going to do?

81
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,190
You can define a third optional parameter, which is that eliminated?

82
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,320
Which does this function?

83
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,930
When to stop processing the input?

84
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,660
OK, now suppose we run this code and we want to give a paragraph.

85
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,560
I suppose I like reading books.

86
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:35,340
And Java, Python and C++ are my favorite programming languages, and I hate do it now.

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:45,230
What it does, it did stored the entire input until it sort of took it did not store this dog.

88
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,580
But it did stored the entire input inside a character.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,300
OK.

90
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,690
That means you can use scene to get line.

91
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,980
Whether they eliminated and you can tell at what character I should stop processing the input, OK,

92
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:07,760
so you have the error name, you have the land of the free and you have a character that is a delimit

93
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,760
which tells this input, this function, when to stop processing and it stops processing when it hits.

94
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,010
Not.

95
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,720
This is how this function is going to work.

96
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,750
I hope you got some idea about how you can take input inside the CreditEddie and in the next few years,

97
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,690
you will discuss more concept.
