1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,320
I say in this lecture, we're going to talk about or to recruit terrorists.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,240
And let's see.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:18,250
So basically, in order to define a two degree activity, you can actually do use that I've got, followed

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,180
by name of the Eddy.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,060
And this is one way in which you can in each laser to that it will get another way could be you can

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,340
write numbers off the number of rules and the maximum number of columns that you will support.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,480
I will go ahead.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,430
The number of rules is optional.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,130
If you are giving a initialization list like this.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,200
Then you can also do it like this, let's say a followed by B, followed by a C, followed by null.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,000
This is one thing.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,590
Then maybe second row second is easy or only.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:01:00,280
And so the the thing is this way is not very this doesn't look good and it involves a lot of work to

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,200
write this kind of index as well.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,970
So what we do, we write each row as a string.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,680
So each row, each ring actually represents a linear idea because if you see in the memory level what

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,990
is going to happen, this is going to.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,320
This is going to be a grid in which we are going to have approximately exactly 10 columns in each row.

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:32,060
So this is how it is going to get stored, and I will just show it to you how these are going to get

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,450
stored.

21
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,920
We have one, so we will have you here and here.

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,040
We had followed by an.

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,750
We have to be W or no.

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,610
We have three b h e none.

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,490
And so on.

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,880
OK.

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,890
The number of columnists and columns, that means this index was from zero to nine.

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,080
And the number of those is decided by how many elements we have here.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,290
Up to this.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,170
We have.

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,810
But this is how it would be corrected at a store, and now you may ask, OK, if I want to print a particular

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,290
role, how I can do it, so you can simply do see out numbers of some.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,130
So I think this will print the entire rule.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,940
And if you simply do numbers of like Ma0, it will print the zero correct provided or this will print

35
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,640
the first character off.

36
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,020
I had thought, maybe let's say I use five zero one two three.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,760
Let's say is three, we are talking about digital.

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,770
And let me show it to you.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,230
We should protocols and we call on here.

40
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,420
And if I had underscored.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,260
I'd like to the connectivity.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,680
And you going to be regarding the letter all here?

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,230
That means this we are talking about this letter.

44
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,670
And if I simply do OK, I want to print the I at all, then it is going to print.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,970
The entire row.

46
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,470
OK, so you going to this is branding 40?

47
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,760
We're going to even read over all the rules I can say for integral to zero.

48
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,050
I less than.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,870
Six plus plus, I can see out numbers of I.

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,890
If I were to scold, if I run it, you're going to be able to print all the strings.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,260
So this is a behavior that is little different from the indeed it it is.

52
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,860
And if you simply do print this address.

53
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,620
So this this is actually the address.

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:41,980
OK.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,350
This is not the entire thing.

56
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,200
The number of I actually print the entire electorate.

57
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,650
OK.

58
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,680
But if you printed foreign indeed it, Eddie, this is not going to happen.

59
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:05,430
Suppose if I change this day today and I finish laser in rigidity and then this is, then you will get

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,330
an address, OK?

61
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,200
So this is because code read character that is differently, OK?

62
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,440
See, outrage corrected.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,380
That is differently.

64
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,390
And it is.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,300
A behavior that is conditionally written inside, does the old statement look, it doesn't happen for

66
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,410
all types of errors, it only happens for the character it is.

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,250
OK, so I hope you understood how we can represent an array of strengths as a 2D character, Eddie.

68
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,750
So that's it.

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
That's all for this lecture.

70
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,790
Thank you.
