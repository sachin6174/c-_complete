00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,440
Hello, everyone, in this lecture, I want to talk about a few important methods that are available

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,970
with the C style strings.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,660
So what have been upgraded or corrected?

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,250
And what I want to calculate the length of this that, okay, how many characters it has in Bluecoat

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,270
trillion.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,600
This is a function that is available, and they can give the name of dairy the name of the character

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,780
credit for which I want to do this work.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,280
So if I show you the output, it gives me five.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,530
So you can see it has five letters.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,720
And if you talk about storage, it actually has six letters because it is also note that we need it.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,300
Okay, so that is the first function that we have seen.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,740
If we want to calculate the length, we can use the Australian function.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,290
The next function is string copy.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,590
If we want to copy one string to another, this string, we can easily do it using string copy function.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,920
We don't need to write off our look to do the work so we can just string copy copy the value of A to

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,220
B.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,040
OK, so the first parameter is their destination.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,320
But if we want the word and the second is the source.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,640
So if they copy it from the value of A to B, and if I do see Old B, you can see B them to string.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,990
But if I print B to here, I can see it will contain the word apple.

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,440
OK.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,190
So you can see it contains the word apple, and that's how the string copy function works.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,720
And obviously it is doing it later, later and it is going to take linear time.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,010
So we have seen string copy.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,230
The third is string compared.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,660
So string compared basically tells us whether two strings are equal at night so I can check.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,930
I can compare.

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,080
And B So if if all the letters match, this function is going to return zero.

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,080
So let us see what happens.

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,840
So yes, it is giving us a zero because both the strings are equal and if it is not equal, it will

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
give us plus y not a minus one.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:06,420
So let us say let us add something to the B, so maybe I can see I can use this string concatenate function

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,870
that is that goes by the name S.T.A.R.T..

34
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,300
I want to concatenate two strings.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,640
Maybe I can say, let me show you one example here.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,380
So let's say God.

37
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,130
Web equals do W W W and Gad domain equals to.

38
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,250
Letter calling minutes.

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,070
Dot com.

40
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,820
I want to concatenate these two into one so I can to code SDR.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,600
Eddie and I can to web and domain, and let's see.

42
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,760
And you can see we're getting W W W coding minutes.

43
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,560
Dot com.

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,340
OK, maybe I'll put a dotted.

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,950
And now we can see.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,940
We are able to concatenate these two things now, I can also compared this string.

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,310
With with so this this is going to output a string and I can copy this value inside me, I can just

48
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,070
drink coffee this drink and to be OK, so let's see what happens now.

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,220
And if I do see or be here, it would be me would take the value coding when it start going.

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,470
OK, so we ask Non-coding when it start.

51
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:36,860
Come on, I can compare this with Apple, so I can this out string compared and b now this output will

52
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,550
not be zero.

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,810
It would be something else.

54
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,400
Let me show it to you.

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,690
So this output is actually negative.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,050
OK.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,380
And if I change this order, become a it would be positive, I guess.

58
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:55,740
OK.

59
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,260
So, yes, it is minus 22 and it is plus 22.

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,420
So it basically returns a positively or negatively or a zero.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:06,800
OK.

62
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,700
So in three directions, this string compare can go.

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,870
And if you're interested in actually knowing how this value is computed, I will not tell you, go to

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,640
their documentation and read about what more functions are available.

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,170
And with this, see style strings.

66
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,240
OK, go and read about it on the web.

67
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,570
OK.

68
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,290
That's all for this lecture.

69
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,870
Thank you for joining.
