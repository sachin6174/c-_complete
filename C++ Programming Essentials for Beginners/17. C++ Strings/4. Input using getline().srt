00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to see how do we work with input using strings?

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:13,510
OK, so we have seen how to input characters, how to input character at ease, and now we are going

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,440
to see how do we take input from the user and put it inside the string object?

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:28,420
OK, now one thing we're going to do is maybe I can string input demo and we are going to use some of

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,050
the code.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,670
As a boss, we have created a string on instead of initializing it what we want, we want to take user

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,030
input.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,940
Maybe I can say, bring me.

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,160
And I want you to seen me.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,950
So let's see, does it accept the name correctly or not?

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,160
So maybe out high plus name.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,710
And we have seen the plus operator does work with those translate.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,750
OK, we have.

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,060
Yeah, this is fine.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:16,890
And maybe I can say dodge lasting input, though, so it's waiting for names, so I can say the nodding.

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,030
And it only gives me the first word, OK?

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,340
The same issue we did solve it corrected.

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,030
It is as well.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,430
So Sign does not read once it sees us space.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:36,840
OK, so that that means we need some other method to read these strings, which are which do contain

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,530
spaces, OK?

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,150
The scene will not work.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,280
It does not work with strings containing spaces.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:52,140
It will just go into doubt and will use a function which is actually known as guideline on guideline

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,850
function can be used in two ways.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,510
So in the first, it accepts this in object.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,950
It uses the scene object to read something and then it tries to store it inside.

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:12,660
And the object that have to give because we are saying, OK, I'm going to read something from the user

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,050
and not input would be copied inside it.

30
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,650
Now, if you don't put it, will fix of an issue.

31
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,520
And if I give the name to the Ignite and it does read the entire name book including spaces as well.

32
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,540
Now, another way of doing it, maybe you are interested to read a paragraph, maybe.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,620
Some paragraph which is extending multiple lines right down, there is no such way of giving this input,

34
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,960
so I've got a paragraph as we hit a new line.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,010
The input reading it does terminate because what we want.

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,830
We don't want to store at the new line.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,010
We want to stop and maybe some other character that is little toilet or not something like that.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,710
It's totally your choice where you want to stop.

39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,160
Now you can do it.

40
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,320
I want to read everything until I hit the dollar.

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:13,820
OK, maybe I got maybe some, some dollars, maybe one one two two, three, three or four or five six

42
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,190
on some string hello.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,810
And then I have a dollar or it is going to read everything until you don't see your dollar.

44
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,240
So this little is known as a delimited.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,060
And by default, if you don't pass anything, it assumes this to be a box lesson.

46
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,490
Or if you tell, No, I don't want the starboard box lesson, I want to stop at it.

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,560
It does acknowledge that, OK, so that is another way of using the Great Line function.

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,560
I hope are reading input is now clear.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:49,610
So what we have seen till now is not if you want to read a character you use seeing Dot Gate, which

50
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,330
reads as in the letter, if you want to read a character you do use seemed odd.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,210
Great line method, which we have seen.

52
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,780
And if you want to read a string you don't use, not get like you actually use a method great line which

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:12,440
does accept string and a fine object, which is being input to this method.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,710
OK?

55
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,380
So these are different ways of reading strings that we have seen so far.

56
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,910
And I hope you understood this one, and that's all for this video.
