00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:08,270
Everyone in this lecture, I'm going to talk about C++ drinks, and in order to understand the concept

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:15,890
of a string glass, we need to have a rough idea of a brief idea of object oriented programming will

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,910
get to do.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,360
We do have a section on object oriented programming in this course.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,010
But what ooops helps us, it helps us to define Real-World entities in terms of objects.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:36,830
For example, you want to define a paintbrush which might be needed for a paint application in your

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,280
system.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,500
And what?

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,690
This Bainbridge cannot.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,490
It can have a certain state.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:51,080
And it can have a certain behavior to OK, the state means the data it knows about itself.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,270
Can you think of any dumps, I mean anything related to the crash?

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,970
Of course, a plane crash can have a certain color.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,040
It can have a certain size.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,130
It can have maybe some other properties as well.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Maybe the kind of connected it has or something like that, OK?

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,520
Or how what would be the stroke rate and something like that?

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,510
And it can have certain behavior like it can paint.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,050
OK.

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,520
And maybe we can change the color of the paint brush that might be a method available on this paintbrush.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,490
Maybe we can reset the paint brush to the default size and color.

22
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,350
Maybe that could be a method, right?

23
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:42,860
What we are trying to say is that using the concept of object oriented programming, we can define glasses.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:51,410
The glasses actually kind of a template which as in which you can define certain properties and you

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,900
can define certain behavior, OK?

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,620
But this does not mean a paintbrush, so a paintbrush is created when you create an object out of it.

27
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:58,910
OK.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,360
So we learn the concept of glasses and we will learn about the concept of objects.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,940
And we will deal with object oriented programming.

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,870
So I'll just tell you how this is done.

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,270
Maybe you guys use OK.

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,310
It is a paintbrush be.

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,430
And all this brush has certain colors, so you can see we color.

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,810
This is equal to red.

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,370
OK.

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,870
And then you guys, OK, I want to paint using the red color so you will be docked, OK?

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,380
What I'm trying to tell you is that when we are going to work with strings, we are actually going to

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,600
create strings like this.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,450
The string is a predefined glass will create a string.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,240
And we call this thing as an object.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:42,900
OK.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,290
And this object is of the type, strings or type.

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Is this like a data type, but it has some additional functionality inside it.

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,670
So this has some built-in methods which are defined inside a string glass.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:06,540
And this is defined in a header file called It's up as part of the C++ standard template library framework

46
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,050
and will include it using harsh include string.

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,470
OK.

48
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,970
Now, instead of calling standalone functions and passing them the data, we will say I want to do as

49
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,380
dart.

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,350
Maybe it is.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,110
Maybe I want to erase something inside this particular string.

52
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,950
Maybe some index.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,330
OK, now this is weird.

54
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,480
Object oriented programming is going to come, so we will not have a function like it is, and we are

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,190
passing it a string and then sending it somewhere and we will do as though it is OK.

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,580
Whenever you see a syntax like where you have some variable name or object name, followed by Dart,

57
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,480
it is an operated and this is a function or a method.

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:48,960
OK.

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,080
OK, now just try to see this is actually object oriented programming, so though we have not learned

60
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,560
yet.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,200
But I'm just telling you that we would be using functions in this particular style when we are going

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,330
to start with the strings in the next video.

63
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,970
And that's all for this video.

64
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,060
We'll look into the more details in the next lecture.
