00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:06,980
Everyone, so I hope you have got some idea of working with String, so I'm just going to show you the

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,910
documentation on C++ dot com and you can have a look.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,910
There are so many methods that this string class does support.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,340
There is a method, a pencil.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,600
If you want to add something to the string, it can.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,050
It can be used, OK.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,080
So there are examples as well, so you can add a new string.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,500
You can say, OK, I want to add up to five letters, so dots would be added something like that.

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,150
Or you can play with this.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,460
OK, it's a very easy function that you can play with.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:46,550
So our function we have already seen it gives us index are the particular letter, and we also have

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,350
some other functions like resolve or our find.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,200
Or so I'll give you an example.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,630
Let's talk about the sub string function.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,410
It generates a newly new constructed string with its value initialized to a copy of substring of this

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:04,750
object.

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,030
What is a substring?

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,590
Even a bigger string?

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
A part of the string is a substring we'll give, for example.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,230
This is a bigger string, and I'm saying, will you give me a string which starts from the third index?

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,360
So zero, one, two and three?

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,430
Basically, it starts from deep and it contains up to five letters.

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,320
That is what this sub string method is going to give us.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,760
And we can also use the find function were to look at where a particular world is located, at what

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,060
index it is present, so we can also use that.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,880
So you can see there are so many methods, and I would suggest you go through some of these methods

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,390
on your own.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
And I will show you some examples where we can use these methods to solve problems in the next video.
