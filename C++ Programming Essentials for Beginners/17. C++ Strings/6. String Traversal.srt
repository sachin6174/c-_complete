00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:07,330
Hello, everyone, so in this video, we're going to talk about privacy, and I'll just give you a quick

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,700
idea of how we can a voice on a connectivity vs. traversal on a string.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,020
OK.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:22,060
First of all, let's I have some GoDaddy, and let's say this in this, we are storing a string, let's

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,510
say.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:32,500
Inside an during the string, according minutes, and I suppose I won't do I dread over this entirely

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,630
on print everything later so I can default and I go lose it.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,660
Tell what what lengths United, so either I compute the land of the city.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,160
I can say I then is still alien of name.

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:57,300
I this place and I can to see out the name of why that is like one option of doing the iterations.

11
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,910
Let me just build a code and let me show you the output.

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:01,690
So.

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:11,750
We're going to we are able to iterate over all the strengths, which is what is actually happening at

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,360
the plant.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,760
Let me just tell you.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,570
It is during this string, hello, and that is getting stored inside your character, so you have zero

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:31,300
h one e two, you have the index, you have a water index, you have oil on on the fifth and next you

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,590
will actually have a which is created by the string copy function.

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,280
Now we are saying that we want to hydrate less than lend lend of this world is actually five.

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,950
We are saying that Ireland is vital when we want to trade less than land.

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,040
OK, so that means we are retreating from the index zero.

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,150
So that is what we are getting the right set of characters that we want.

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:01,360
We don't want to print none or the other way of doing it as you copy the same code and use it all.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,670
I don't want to use the lend function.

25
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,100
I want to settle name of I.

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,260
This is not equal to.

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,480
This is also why so sometimes you will find this way of doing that reversal, and it will still produce

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,560
the same output.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,760
Let me show it to you.

30
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,240
So both of them, they produce the same.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,340
So what we are doing, we are iterating over an edit later, by later, and that's what the output is.

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,580
Now let us also discuss how we can trade over a string.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,770
The one day theme, the string is actually a collection of characters that I've been a string object.

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,670
Or maybe I can do string name that is quoting minutes and I want to.

35
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,020
I trade it so I can do for intake will do zero starting from zero.

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,140
The.

37
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,690
I want to go tell what I need.

38
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,760
And so what function we will use.

39
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,860
Instead of calling the Stirling Albion method, we will use named Portland.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,810
Now this is a method that is built on string object.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,820
And this is how we can use this method.

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,710
And I can see out.

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,600
Name of a and that again, we are going to get.

44
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,760
The same, so we cannot use the same video, but maybe I can say name.

45
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,720
One named one unnamed one, right?

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,270
So.

47
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,150
OK.

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,250
Instead of putting it in, we should put maybe a comma or whatever.

49
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,520
And you and I I'll tell you one more way of doing it.

50
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,140
Just hold on for a minute.

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
We are still getting the same.

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,830
You can see that reversal is pretty much the same, right?

53
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,430
And there is also a loop with Disney on ice for each loop.

54
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,270
What it does, it hydrates over all the letters on.

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,480
Let me show you this index right now you're iterating over correct.

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,460
So you will create a bucket which will temporary hold one letter at a time.

57
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,320
You can say some x and I want to iterate over name one, which is a string, right?

58
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,750
So I can to see outtakes.

59
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,210
So it's all going to hold one character at to it.

60
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:26,490
It is automatically going to iterate over each element of this object of this string, which is a character,

61
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:26,790
right?

62
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,390
And now you're going to still we are getting the same output.

63
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,460
So this is a faulty loop that is another way of doing the traversal, right?

64
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:44,160
And maybe if you say, no, I don't want to iterate over this as a character that I want to iterate,

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,110
but I will interpret everything as an integer.

66
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,730
So you're going to index that isn't right.

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,280
Name one.

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Instead of getting the characters, we are going to get the ASCII values of all the letters right.

69
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,070
Let me show it to you.

70
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,350
Now we are getting the Oscar news off all the numbers with the president in this right.

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,760
These are a few ways in which you can reverse either on the character ready or on a string, and that's

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,650
all for this video.
