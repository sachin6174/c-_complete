1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,590
So now we have learned how to use private and public access modifiers.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,860
And but now we're going to learn a concept in which we are going to fix this problem.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,190
That selling price should not be less than what we are going to do.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,030
We are going to restrict the access of these data members.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,800
Firstly, we are going to make them as private and we are going to provide some public methods that

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,180
will modify the MRP and the selling price.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,680
Okay, so maybe there is a method void that might be OK.

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,610
And it is a method wide that selling price.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,050
Now, let's say we get some price and we say, OK, this MRP should be equal to price.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,040
And here we get some selling price and we say, OK, maybe again we may be passing somebody the price

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,510
and we say, OK, the link price should be called the price.

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,260
Now what is going to happen?

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,570
We are going to remove this code.

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,800
And instead of calling this method.

15
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,780
We will call instead of directly accessing the property, we will call the method September BNZ selling

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,230
price.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,990
So I can see camaraderie that it might be, let's drag on camera, Dodd said selling price later to

18
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,350
wounded.

19
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,930
It is not going to fix the issue and it is again going to cause one problem that.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,680
You can see this is again, a private number, and we cannot noted the values of price, and that might

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,230
be so what we need, right?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,790
I know the function that we have great known as sectors that is taking some property off the camera.

23
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,720
But we are going to also create ghettos.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:05,350
Are going to return some property of the product and get MRP that is going to return the MRP and get

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,940
selling price that is going to there, done the selling price.

26
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,450
OK, now.

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,630
OK.

28
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,320
Oh.

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,190
Yeah.

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,560
So again, here we will see Cameron not get out, so we are now going to call the method instead of

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,440
accessing the property and get selling price.

32
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,790
And you can see other problem will now be solved.

33
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,110
OK, this should be camera, don't go telling place.

34
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,090
All right.

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,770
So if I underscored now so we can see again, we have a mighty period, but we have selling prices 200

36
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,720
but should not happen.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,120
What it means is now we are able to replicate the same functionality that we have done earlier using

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,310
the concepts of greater intelligence.

39
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,690
But these are more powerful by because.

40
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,990
Here we have a matter in which we can pull back and be strategic, so we can say when we are sending

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,040
a selling price, we can put additional checks here that.

42
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:50,160
If Price is greater than what might be, then we can say we will set the selling price equal to MRP.

43
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,840
OK, otherwise we can set the selling price equal the price.

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,860
That means if you put a price that is lower than or equal to MRP, then you will, then this price will

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,470
get updated, otherwise it will not get updated.

46
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,310
So that's what we are doing it.

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,590
OK?

48
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,160
So let let me let me show it to you if I said selling price equal to 200.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,680
And if I underscored again so you can see both MRP and selling price are now 100.

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,420
OK.

51
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,190
And if I say no, the selling price should be 90.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,090
And I what we should Bernard, then this will get updated.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,490
So selling prices 19 MRP under OK.

54
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,410
And if I say it should be 190, then it would be made as it.

55
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,920
OK, so you're going to so we can see the concept of greater than traders are quite powerful when we

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,970
are going to work with glasses and object.

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,050
So that's all for this lecture and I hope you understood.

58
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:00,120
Now we have used both data members and we have provided methods to the public in order to work with

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,410
these drivers, and we can put additional stakes and constraints when the values of these data members

60
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:07,770
are set.

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,100
OK.

62
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:17,400
So that's all for this lecture, and maybe you can also check that the price should be greater than

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,720
zero.

64
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,660
So if is negative, then this price will not update.

65
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:21,990
OK.

66
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,040
Only then you should update the price.

67
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,350
Maybe if someone says, OK, let me said the ad might be as miners are injured, then this is not going

68
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,760
to work.

69
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,050
All right, so that's all for this lecture, thank you.
