00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,890
Everyone in this lecture, I'm going to give you a demo of working with dynamic areas.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,270
So let's see how we can create one at it.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,540
And also we can delete it.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,140
So we have main.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:23,830
And suppose I take and put away Lewin, and I want to create a dynamic area of size and.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,120
They will write and study equals Nuland.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,960
And here I can give, say then and then you can also do initialization, maybe using a loop or something.

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,950
I lived in Ecuador, I lived in an A-plus place.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,140
I knew in the area of I.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,570
Equals LHC.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,820
And maybe we want to print these values as well.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,000
I can see that if they.

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,340
So let's build this good.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,580
And try to run it, we have dynamic that is demo.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,550
So maybe I won't do have an array of 10 elements, and you can see this is how we can create area of

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,980
an image as oppose.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,820
At this point, my work is done.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,520
I want to free up this memory.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,920
I can delete the city and I can say, OK, let's delete.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:28,050
This edit, and that's it, so this memory will get freed at this point before coming to return zero.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,480
What happened is we have at every level in mean we have a dynamic it in heap.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,860
So this is your family.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,910
So when we come to this line by this line, we have already deleted this part of the memory, but this

24
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,010
video will still store the address of this address later.

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,240
This values to zero four.

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,910
So this and this will still persist in the memory, OK?

27
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,530
Because.

28
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,580
It doesn't the.

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,590
Starting memory, OK, so it is the memory of the main function and main function is not yet over.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:02,940
OK.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,380
Main function is over when this block is finished.

32
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,280
Even if I do see out error here, I will still get the address of that particular day.

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,760
OK.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,560
So let me show it to you.

35
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,940
So if those are 10 elements so you can do this is the address of the area on this address would be same

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,980
as this one.

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,900
OK, I'm just going to.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,110
Trying to clear the concepts, OK, so when you delete the.

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,420
So the static address doesn't get deleted until the long term goal is over or the scope of variable

40
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:52,140
as it is there, then it will not get destroyed, but the dynamic memory will definitely get destroyed.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,040
So if I give 10 hit so you can do these two addresses are same, but maybe let us try to print what

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,850
is the right area of two maybe sealed area off to?

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,480
Now, let's see what what happened in this case.

44
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,430
Although we're still getting to oh, we're still getting to, but there is a possibility that.

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,790
So what happened is in this case, we had a heap at a particular memory location.

46
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,540
We are there to do.

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,880
We put it on.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,370
We had appointed to this memory.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,650
Now when we use the delete command, this record destroyed.

50
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,730
But that doesn't mean the data which is presented may or may not have the same value case or data that

51
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,800
is present at this look.

52
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,790
Data present aren't.

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,860
Address, it may get overridden by some other.

54
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,050
Some other data on the old data may persist, or you may might get segmentation fault as well.

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,040
So this behavior is not predictable, so ideally we should not do this.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,180
So this is not recommended because we have deleted the edit.

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,770
So I hope this short demo about one bit is this clear.

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,980
And in the next lecture, I will give you an example of how we can create 2D dynamic videos.

59
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,240
OK, so let's see.
