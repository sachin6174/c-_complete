1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,890
Everyone know we're going to talk about binary left shift.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,840
So what does this operator so generally you will find us operated a little like this.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,310
Let's have five left shift.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,080
So what does it mean?

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,260
It basically means we have a number five.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:18,880
OK.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,150
And whatever it is, the bet it has.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,460
We're going to leave shift all the bits by a factor of two.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,980
So everything is going to move towards lived by a factor of two.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,400
So what?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,150
What will happen?

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,210
These two bits will fall off, OK?

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,240
And you will have something like this.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,000
Zero zero one zero one.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,010
And from here, you will add those zeros.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,360
OK.

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,480
So you lied like this if you try to understand what is different in this number?

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,970
So this was two days to bar zero.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,220
This was to raise the bar one.

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,290
This was directly part two bar to are two stories to the bar zero to to one.

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,680
And this is to raise the bar two.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,870
This is two arrested bartenders as directed by.

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,060
What is the original number?

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,440
So original number is five.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,070
OK.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,590
And that is equal to those squared.

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,350
Love Story 3.0, and we know this is faith.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,380
And let let let us call this number as.

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,620
Now if I talk about this number.

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,960
OK, so what is this number?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,990
So it does nothing, but it does do squirt less door for it.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,020
If you take two square common you're left with, you're left with two squared plus two arrested, about

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,410
zero.

34
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,640
That means it has two squared off the original Number X, basically doing a left shift by two.

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,760
Has multiplied that number by two squared.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,050
OK.

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:56,510
So basically a left shift B will multiply a with it days to the power B.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,460
This is what I'm trying to say.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,440
And if you see what is this number?

40
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,890
This number is nothing but 16 plus four.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,040
This number is 20.

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,370
Effectively have got multiplied by two days to.

43
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,080
But that is five in the water district.

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,620
Effectively, when you do a left shift, the number is multiplied with the power of two.

45
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,380
So this is the left shift operator.

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,270
I hope this one is now clear.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,440
Similarly, we also have something known as a right shift.

48
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,600
The left shift does multiplication right shift divides OK?

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,180
Let us start with one example.

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,270
Let's say I have a number 10, and if I do a right shift with one, that means I'm going to divide by

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,290
two days to divide one.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,740
OK.

53
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,730
So if I show you this number, then in binary is one zero one zero.

54
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:54,110
And that means if this is the number, doing the right shift means we are moving every bit towards right

55
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,770
by one step.

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,130
This bit will get discarded, and the original number would become zero zero zero one zero one.

57
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,260
OK.

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,390
And clearly, we know this number is five.

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:13,610
So if we do 10 right shift one, that means divide by 10, divided by two to one.

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,220
This number is five and this number is also five.

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,480
Again, if you do right, shift one here, it's a hard number.

62
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,950
You should get to this doing right shift one had means zero zero zero.

63
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,260
This one will fall off and we will get something like this one zero.

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,580
So this number is two.

65
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,430
Does this same as doing five divided by two this terrible one?

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,550
That is OK.

67
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,260
And similarly, if you do it once again, you will end up getting zero zero zero one.

68
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,850
And this number is one.

69
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,480
And let's do it once more.

70
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,600
You will do zero zero zero zero.

71
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,190
This number would be zero.

72
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,790
If I do 10 right shift four, then that means 10 divided by two ways to divide four.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,300
And that is 16.

74
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,380
So this number would be zero.

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,250
OK.

76
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,280
So eight night shift basically means eight divided by two days to ever be OK.

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,800
So I hope both left shift and right shift are now clear to you on in the coming lectures, we will see

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,040
some examples where these operators can be used.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,720
That's all for this lecture.

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,200
Thank you.
