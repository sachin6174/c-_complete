Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,110
So let us writers who report for computing simple interest, so we have to read BRT and compute simple

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,530
interest.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,880
So as we're discussing the flowchart, the first step is always read.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,140
The first step is start.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,990
In this case, we will not have to start.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,870
We're going to read B, R and B.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,880
All right.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,370
Then we will compute simple interest.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,680
That is B into R into B divided by 100.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,100
OK, so we can put this like this?

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,970
And then we can look brand, simple interest and exit.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,860
That's it.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,270
That's the four line good to compute, simple interest.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,490
And this is that look good, OK?

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,910
So I hope you have understood this pseudocode.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,830
And that's all for this video.
