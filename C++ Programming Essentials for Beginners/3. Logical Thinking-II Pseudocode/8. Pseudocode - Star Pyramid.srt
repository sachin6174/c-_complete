1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,720
I so now we will solve this pyramid pardon problem, so we have to print this kind of a burden for a

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,070
given.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,330
And so in this burden, we have three rows.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,870
And as you can see in each row, there are some spaces followed by some started OK.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,760
So first of all, I will write the observations.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,430
So the observation is there are Andrews.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,480
OK.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,770
And in each row, there are some spaces.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,920
How in this business that we will figure it out?

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,340
Followed by some number of stops, OK, followed by some number of stunts.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,030
We have to generalize this for any.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,180
I threw.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,970
So let us see what happened in this president.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,380
If you look carefully that there are those places it.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,140
OK, and they're the ones buried under zeros, basically zero, because we've right the number of spaces

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,790
in the air through two spaces, one space, zero space.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,710
So as we are going down, as the value of I is increasing, OK, the number of spaces is decreasing.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,480
We can see as one is two and three.

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,070
That is the rule number two.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,880
Can you relate?

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,810
Can you generalize how many spaces are there in our group?

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,360
Clearly, we can see that this is nothing but three minus two to the three minus one.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,960
That is, we have two spaces, OK?

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,520
In the second row, we have three minus the rule number.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,600
We have one space in the third row, we have three minus three.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,370
That is zeros.

27
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,090
But clearly we can get these spaces by doing.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,830
And miners say in the Dietro era and miners ice business, this we figured out through our observation

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,490
the better and miners ice bases in the hydro.

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:12,970
Now, let us talk about the number of stars, how many stars we have one star, three stars and five

31
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,480
stars.

32
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,480
Let's figure out the formula for stars.

33
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,470
One Star Resort and five stars.

34
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,190
OK.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,390
Now, let's see how we can generalize this one.

36
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,960
So the role no doubt, is a.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,870
That is nothing but one, two and three.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,530
So if you look carefully in the first rule, one starts, they wrote three star third Rule five stars

39
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,300
by observation.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,020
I considered in in the intro that there is doing to a minus one stars because this value is nothing

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,910
but two into one minus one.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,440
This is nothing but two into the minus one that is three.

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,860
This is doing two three minus one.

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,560
So yes, we are able to generalize the number of stars.

45
00:02:59,580 --> 00:02:59,820
OK.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,400
So again, this is through observation.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,030
OK.

48
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,650
If you don't want to observe if you want to use a predefined formula.

49
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:16,230
So what happens is that the number of stars, the former sequence of the type, which is known as automatic

50
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,620
progression in a bizarre sequence.

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,470
Split the difference between two consecutive terms is consent.

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,780
So this is common difference, which is to this is common difference that just this different is constant

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,610
across all their terms.

54
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,270
So if you want to find out the item of this AP, there is a formula which is a plus a minus one in duty.

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,650
So what is it is the first dump b the difference between two consecutive terms.

56
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,420
So what is it?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,460
Is one is A and B is due so you can do one plus do a minus two.

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,140
It does alter the way mine is, either you use the AP formula or you can use the observation, what

59
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,700
are going to give you the same result?

60
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,050
And hence we can see that there are two into a minus one stars.

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,820
In the eye.

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,130
OK, now we we have seen how to break down this pattern.

63
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,730
OK?

64
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,500
And after printing to a minus one size, I will also print a new line.

65
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,590
So now you can write the pseudocode for this problem, so that is very easy.

66
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,890
So first, we will read how many doors we have, then we will need a loop.

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,560
Why did our those first Rosekind again?

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,010
So let's say we are starting from the first rule.

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,410
We will go till the end that rule.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,850
What we will do, we need you.

71
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,840
We will do three things.

72
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,060
First, we will print faces.

73
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,890
Let's face it is one how many spaces and minors spaces?

74
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,550
Wild spaces is less than equal to and minus.

75
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,900
What we will do will print a space and we will implement the ground of spaces that has been printed

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,650
by one.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,250
That's it.

78
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,030
The next thing that we have to do is doing do a minus one start.

79
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,590
So let us print us.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,830
Let's say the ground started this one wireless dodgers less than equal to two and do a minus one.

81
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,430
What we will do will print a style and will increment the count of stars by one.

82
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:36,490
The article to plus one gadget, followed by a new line, so we will talk it will print a new line.

83
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,670
And we will go to the next drill by doing a call like this one.

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,240
That's it.

85
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,940
That completes our zero vote.

86
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,320
And here we can write exit.

87
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:54,050
Now you can see this is how we have broken down our logic into smaller components.

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,410
This loop is responsible for borrowers.

89
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,810
And the inner parts responsible for.

90
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,800
Some part of the.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,980
So this part is responsible for spaces in each row.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,040
This is responsible for stars they need to do.

93
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,600
This is responsible for shifting the cursor to the new line.

94
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,180
And this I called my plus one maintains.

95
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,370
It is a great condition for the out-of-date book.

96
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,930
So.

97
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,420
This is how we can afford this burden now as a homework, you can write in this pardon on your own.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,190
But I do write in this for and value and equal look forward and try to see what pattern do you get?

99
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,520
OK, so that's all for this video.

100
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,060
Thank you.
