00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,640
Everyone in this lecture will discuss the pseudocode to check if a number is prime one or two.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,220
Let us recall the flowchart that we have drawn to check a number is prime or not.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,120
Now let us try to convert this flowchart into the code, OK?

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,990
The first step is read and look read and.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,560
The next step is, Initialise, is because we are trying to find out it in the range to do n minus one,

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,710
so he's OK, let equal to two and here which is a smaller then.

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,560
And so here we also see that this is a part of a loop.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,080
This part is done repeatedly.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,210
We take while.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,960
I is less than and are you going to do violence less than equal to n minus one?

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,370
Both are fine.

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,880
To hear what you're doing, you're repeatedly checking the foreign number and you're checking that,

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,060
is there any adviser in the range to do and minus one?

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,000
So the value of I is going from two trillion minus one that is less than to what you're taking hit.

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,790
Your checking is and divisible by.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,600
So you will if it OK, this is this is not a look.

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,190
This is a starting point of the law.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,010
This is if if.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,410
And is divisible by I.

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,500
If an is divisible by then, what are you going to do?

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,230
You can simply say that this number is not prime and you can ignore.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,400
This is what we have seen, so we're going to print.

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,450
Not Prime.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,420
And begin to exit as soon as we get one device that.

25
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,360
We consider this number is not.

26
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,850
And we can exit, OK.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,790
So for this very look, we have to stop being territorial.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,520
We have written the work that needs to be done.

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,930
We have done the initial look and listen to what is left as the update condition, OK.

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,570
So if an is not divisible by, I then go to the next day.

31
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,000
OK.

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,500
That is basically the step I do one day, so it becomes I equal to a plus one.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,410
OK.

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,540
I called up this one.

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,590
Now, if you come out of this vile loop, that means you could not find a device that in this range

36
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,040
it would do and minus one if suppose you get that he has a device that often you would simply hit the

37
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,550
exit.

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,800
But if you're not coming out of the loop, that means you have scanned all numbers still in minus one

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,810
and you could not hit the exit.

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,680
That is why you're coming to this line, where you going to print this as a prime number.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,220
So basically this direction, if you come out of the loop, you can joke that this number is a prime

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,610
number.

43
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,230
And now you can hit the exit.

44
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,730
Your program is complete.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,320
OK, now let us brighten this for an example, it's a seven.

46
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,530
So what happens, you start from two do does not divide seven, you make it three.

47
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,090
OK, we go to three to three is less than seven.

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,890
Three does not divide seven.

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,730
You make it four.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,160
OK, so you come here again for what, less than seven?

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,650
Or does not divide seven?

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,030
So you come here.

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,020
You make it five.

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,500
Five does not divide, seven, you make it six fixes less than seven.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,150
But six does not divide seven.

56
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,130
You will again come here.

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,410
And finally, you make it seven.

58
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,770
The value of I is now seven, which is not less than him.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,350
And you end up with this line.

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,060
I knew circa seven is up and I'm am.

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,100
And that is true.

62
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,270
Seven itself is a prime number.

63
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,180
And then you exit a couple.

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,150
The number like nine.

65
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,220
OK, what happens about nine?

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,170
You start from an equal to two.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
It does not divide it with less than nine.

68
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,080
Two does not divide nine.

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,420
So you come here, you make it three.

70
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,440
It is less than nine, but nine Model three.

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:12,830
This is equal to zero, and hence you print that nine is not time and exit writing exit here means nothing

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,360
below exit would get executed and that is the end of your program.

73
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:25,280
OK, so that is how you can draw a flowchart and to try to look good logic if a number is prime or not,

74
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,040
get so a quick recap of what we have done.

75
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:38,260
So we start from, let's say, riding bicycles to two while I is less than and keep on dividing, OK?

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,690
So if an is divisible by I.

77
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,720
Then you can say, OK, this number is not trying to bring, not prime and exit.

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,420
Otherwise, you go to the next location.

79
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,040
I called you, I +1.

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,110
And if you come out of the loop, that means you could not find a device that you can simply separate

81
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,630
prime and then you can exert, OK.

82
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,560
That is the complete robot for this program.

83
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,390
Thank you.

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,110
I hope you have understood this logic now.
