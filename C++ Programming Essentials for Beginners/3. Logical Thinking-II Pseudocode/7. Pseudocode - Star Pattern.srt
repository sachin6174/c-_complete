1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,560
Everyone in this electoral cycle, the start button problem, so given away live and we want to bring

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,670
the burden like this, OK?

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,640
So first of all, we will try to break this burden to every time you, you get a pardon problem.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,150
You have to look at what is the work that you have to do in every row because the printing happens.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,720
Roberta, there are three rows for an equal to three civil write down some observations.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,100
The first observation is that there are Andrews OK, and the second observation is in each row.

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,290
There are.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,410
Or in Iowa?

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,550
Look, there are a number of stars.

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,230
These are the two observations during these two observations we can call this up.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,620
So this is led to rule number one.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,420
So one.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,310
This is wrong.

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,850
Number two.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,790
It has two stars.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,830
This is rule number three.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,850
It has three stars.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,480
OK.

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,270
And how do you jump from one to another?

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,940
You have to print a special character, which is known as a new line corrected.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,400
So all languages have this correct that it does not visible.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,550
It's not printed like this, but it takes your cursor to the next line.

23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,270
So whenever you print this correct, it takes the cursor to the new line.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,630
OK.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,270
That is the meaning of the new line, correct?

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,650
So let's write those who pseudocode for this problem.

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:30,020
So first of all, we'll read the value of an OK, and then we will need a loop to iterate over those.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,810
So there are two things we have to print arrows repeatedly.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,220
I can get laid equal to one.

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,590
While I was less than equal, doing what we will do will do the work for every rule.

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,190
OK?

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,440
What is the work that we have to do?

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,330
And I drew so in the ayato.

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,310
We have to print a number of times.

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,520
So that means printing high number of stars would again require a loop.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,980
This would again required a loop current number of times.

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,470
So let's see how we can do it so we can look.

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,690
Let's do dodge equal to one.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,170
While stars is less than equal to I.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,740
What we will do will talk, will we will print a start.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:22,180
We'll talk later, printers dot and let's increment the count of stars that we have printed the stars

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,300
as a variable or it's a bucket that is striking how many stars we are printing in the Andrew.

43
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,010
And that's it.

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,860
And after every rule, as we discussed, then we are going to the new rule, we have to print a new

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,630
line corrected that will take the good city to the next line for printing.

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,260
That's it.

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
And finally, we're going to exit the let us do a quick, dry run of this program.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,180
So as one?

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,190
OK, what happened in the first through the stages one and we'll start less than equal to.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,150
So this loop is going to run one times and it is going to print us.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,850
Not after that.

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,420
A new line will come to me, come here and I becomes a plus one.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,760
I becomes to again.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,930
Resist dodges one.

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,920
OK.

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,050
That means this loop is going to run two times, so we print one and two.

57
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,950
OK, so the values of stars is changing from one to and either the stars that we are printing after

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,360
this, the value of I would become three.

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,290
And sides again start from one.

60
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,010
And we will print less than equal to three stories.

61
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,750
So that is one to three.

62
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,850
It will print three stars in the store.

63
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,650
So in each it'll.

64
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,130
This is how the value of stars variable is changing in the first world is one in the secondary during

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,620
the Third World is one to three and so on.

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,810
After this, the value of I would become.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,210
And this is not less than equal to and hence we will stop and we will come out of the loop.

68
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,510
And this is a pattern that you will observe on the screen.

69
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,890
So I hope you have understood the start button, and that's all for this video.
