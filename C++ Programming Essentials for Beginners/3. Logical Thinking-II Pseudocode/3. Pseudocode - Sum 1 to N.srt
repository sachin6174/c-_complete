1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,490
I would want in this lecture and find out the sum of numbers from one twin, I will write to Pseudocode.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:06,900
OK.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,610
So in the flowchart, the first step was to read and then we discussed what we need to maintain.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,150
What is the no, OK, so what is the current number?

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,550
So we'll start from Michael to one, then we will make it do, we'll make it three will make it forward

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,990
and we will go.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:25,890
OK.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,860
And during this, we will also update our son.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
So what we will initially, two things will be OK.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,870
I S1 the initial value of the number and the sum is zero.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,280
So in order to do this, think we need a look, right?

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,940
And for that, we discussed that we can use available to we had while followed by certain condition.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,800
We'll see what that condition is.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,800
That condition would be nothing but while.

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,690
This value of I.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:04,420
OK, this value of AI is less than equal to N, if this is less than equal doing, we can keep on updating

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,330
overtime so we can get some equal to someplace.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,670
So this is the work that we will do in every step, and we will also go to the next value of life that

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,240
is like gold.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,250
Like this one, after we are out of the loop, we can print the value of some and then begin to exit.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:24,970
That's it.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,790
That is how we can write the pseudocode.

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,210
OK.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,570
So if you want to go to a dry run this one so we can talk.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,210
The sum is zero is one that equals I'm blessed because one is less than equal to four.

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,700
It's endless for so some becomes zero plus one.

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,330
That is one.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,180
I becomes what I becomes two.

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,550
OK.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,340
And it was less than equal to for Sam, equal to someplace, plus some becomes one plus two.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,170
That is three.

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,710
I becomes three.

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,790
Now I becomes three three is less than equal to Ford and some blasÃ©, so some becomes plus 3.6.

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,080
OK.

35
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,220
And I comes forward to it takes up this value.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,070
And again, for low as any, the before Suzanne becomes six plus four, that has been.

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,640
And I Begum's faith, so as we see the veil of I becomes five and it is not listening to this look will

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,430
stop and we will come to the line number 16.

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,220
That does bring some.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,620
And here we will print Ben and we will exit.

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,350
OK, that means this pseudocode is working perfectly fine.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,240
And that's all for this video.
