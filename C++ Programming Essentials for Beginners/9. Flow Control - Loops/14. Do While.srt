1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,720
Everyone, so now we have seen the value and the fall.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:11,440
One thing to note about both of these loops is that their entry controls so that what does it mean?

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:19,990
So basically, whenever you write a value, you have a condition that needs to be checked and it's only

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,510
then you enter inside the loop, right?

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,470
So both violent fall, they behave in a similar manner, and they are known as entry control loops.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,440
In this video, we'll talk about the loop, which is actually our exit control loop, right?

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,750
And this is known as a Dubai loop.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,240
So do Block has a set of instructions that will define inside a vile block.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,260
But the thing is the condition is checked at the exit of the gate at the exit.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,430
It is known as that and exert control loops.

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,540
I'll give you a few examples to make this understanding a little better, right?

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,940
So basically, let's say you were running on on a hill and in this case, in the first case, you're

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,380
checking if there is not an edge of the hill or edge of the cliff you are going to run.

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,120
But in the second case, you are going to directly run and after an enduring attack or have encountered

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,030
the edge of the cliff because it's a problem to relate this idea of the entry control loop, which is

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:34,060
over loop and the exit control, which is the low value right now, maybe we can build a code and to

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,210
see what happens then when we use or do well.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,580
So let me show you a quick demo of using this loop, right?

19
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,260
We have Maine and now what we are doing, we are going to do something like, let's say.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,880
It's the end.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,870
Money equals two zero.

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:12,120
And later, do maybe you with your girlfriend and you're doing quite shopping and you don't have anything

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,580
in the pocket, so still you are doing shopping.

24
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,090
And you're saying while money is greater than zero right now, we know that this condition is false.

25
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,410
But what is going to happen?

26
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,600
We are first going to do shopping.

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,660
Even we don't have money in the pocket.

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,390
Okay, so that means this loop will execute at least once again.

29
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,180
This loop will execute at least once.

30
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,470
Let me show you the output of this code, right?

31
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,510
So let me just clear it, and I can say dodge large.

32
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,060
Do I look now you're going to you're getting the output shopping because.

33
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,080
The do block, it's going to execute, then it is going to check for this condition.

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,340
Now what happened is it got executed and now you came here, died, you saw this condition is actually

35
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,790
false.

36
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,770
The money is actually zero eight.

37
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,120
But we have already printed out put on the screen right now, this loop is going to stop.

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,950
Let me show you another example.

39
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,860
Let's say we have something like money equal to five and you're doing shopping, and every time you're

40
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,840
doing shopping, your money is getting reduced.

41
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,430
And maybe you can say I can print how much money is left right.

42
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,630
Shopping and money left.

43
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,180
Let's say let's build this school.

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,340
Now let's try to run this one, right?

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,540
Oh, we should give her nil right now, it would be better.

46
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,780
So shopping and money left.

47
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:54,820
So initially it does five right, and then it does reduce it becomes four and it becomes three, then

48
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,430
it becomes two and it becomes one.

49
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,490
So then when we are printing the statement, money left is one in this line, the money left to zero.

50
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:10,330
That means you're going to come here and you are going to check how much money is left after this step.

51
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,000
When the money left is one in this line, it becomes zero.

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,880
So money is zero.

53
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,370
That means this condition becomes false and this loops stops.

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,160
That means this work is getting repeated again and again until this condition is.

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,250
Until this condition is correct, so as soon as this condition becomes false, your loop is going to

56
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,490
stop.

57
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,340
So this is known as a Dubai loop and this is known as exit control loop, right?

58
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,870
So I hope you have understood the difference and this loop is going to execute at least once, irrespective

59
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,150
of the condition is true or false.

60
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,070
That was the idea behind Dubai Loop.

61
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,440
And that's it.
