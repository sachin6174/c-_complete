00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,740
I loved ones in this lecture, we're going to solve this problem, given a number, we want to find

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,450
the reverse of the item, but a discussion can be approached in two different ways.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,940
So first way is very simple where we don't actually reverse the number, we just print the digits in

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,660
the reverse order.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,690
For example, if the number is two three one four.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,230
So what?

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,570
We will extract the last digit.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,080
OK?

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,660
And you know, the last digit can be extracted by doing so and modern operation.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,660
And maybe we print this last digit, right?

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,830
So we print the number four in the next iteration.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,740
What I want to do, I actually want to get this digit.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,920
So for that, I need to remove this digit, right?

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,450
So I I will remove four by doing any equal to anybody.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,880
So we have reduced the number from two three one four.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,860
We got the last digit and we reduced it to the number two three one right next name again.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,570
What I want to do and I will do the same thing, get the last digit printed, OK and reduce the number.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,780
So get the last digit, which is three.

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,370
Reduce the number.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,200
Make it to get the last digit, that is to print it and reduce the number that is now zero.

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,100
So two divided by 10 is zero.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,020
So every time we are doing the operation.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,160
Anywhere in Britain, and we are printing the last digit.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,440
OK, now this is very easy.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,120
And if you do it for.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,450
The number, the number is greater than zero.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,640
You are actually going to print all the digits of the number in the reverse order, right?

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:47,130
So maybe we have and then and we take and put the value of and this loop is going to print all the digits

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,330
in the reverse order, so we end last digit here, right?

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,050
So now what we will do will run this code and will show you the output, right?

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,850
Let's say dodge, flash, reverse.

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,790
And the number is, let's say, two three one four.

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,160
So I get like four one three two three four one two three, which is correct.

34
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,650
And if I have a number like one zero zero one two two one zero zero one, which is fine, and if I have

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,400
a number like hundred, so I get the reverse as zero zero one.

36
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:35,850
OK, now this is a case where you might expect the reverse to be either zero zero one or you might expect

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,460
the reverse to be only one rate.

38
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,100
So if you store it, if you try to store zero zero one in an integer, you cannot store it, you will

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,090
store only one right now.

40
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,560
This will depend upon what is the sample input output is the problem statement expecting this kind of

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,570
output will with this approach.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,150
If the problem expecting this kind of output, we need to change our approach slightly.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,510
OK.

44
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,170
So now I will discuss the second approach as well, where we'll actually revise the number instead of

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,880
printing it in the next video.
