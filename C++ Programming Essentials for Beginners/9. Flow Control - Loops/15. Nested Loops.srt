00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello, everyone, so in this lecture, we are going to talk about nested loops, what are nested loops

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,510
basically in many problems.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:14,290
You were required to write a loop inside another loop, for example, in Britain, problems or injury

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,330
based problems or in some other problems that relate to what we're doing.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:25,690
We're going to show you that two loops or multiple loops can exist inside each of that.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,080
For example, I want to do something like, maybe I want to print something like a matrix.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:40,900
Maybe I want to print one two three four five six seven eight nine 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 16.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:48,490
OK, now what I'm looking at is that in this kind of a problem, I have those and I also have columns

9
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,420
to be printed, right?

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,190
So this is a little.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,530
Yeah, so this is a little and this is another.

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,670
This is another.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,010
And this is another and this is another right?

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,130
What I need to do, I need to iterate over multiple rules letters starting from low No.

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,570
Zero till the rule.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,110
No.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,800
It's a one, two and three.

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,680
OK, I will.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,580
I will be given or go on to print odd number of rules and I want to print some number of columns.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,830
Is number of columns and maybe I want to print the values which are in a linearly increasing fashion.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,360
Let's see how we can do it.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,460
So firstly, we need to iterate over all the rows right back into four integral to zero I list then

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:45,000
are eight a plus plus we need to define what is the rule number eight and R and C.

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,340
So I'll take those as input from the user.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,220
Now we know, OK, I need to three rows and four columns.

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,870
What we will, we'll go over every row and for every row.

27
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,750
We also have some work, which is repetitive.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,710
We are printing a number and the number is not being initially from one for the first two and then it

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,930
is continuously getting increment.

30
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,070
So we will define a value that is one outside of this.

31
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,300
Or look, because we need this initialization only once we don't need to initialize one in every eight.

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:27,210
What we will do, it will say, OK, for every do I have to print column number of numbers?

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,380
OK, so I will need a loop for printing the columns.

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,110
So Jake called zero dollars, then see.

35
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,860
And as a jobless rate.

36
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,930
And what is the reality?

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
I want to print in every column.

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:48,260
Well, guess what, that is actually this value, which is initially one we can print value followed

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,930
by some space and we can increment that value to a local value plus one.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,500
OK.

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,640
And.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,800
After reading a video of what we have do, we have to go to the new rate so we have to go to new lines

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,770
of illiteracy out and that finishes our work and it looks like we are good.

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,910
So what we have seen here is that this loop is going to run multiple times for every.

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,840
So when I zero, the day is changing from zero to six day gets the value zero letters these three digits,

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,840
the value one day get the value to OK.

47
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,770
Then when I is one day again, get the value zero one two.

48
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,740
When I used to it again, get zero one two.

49
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,160
When I used three, it again gets zero one.

50
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,420
And what we are doing, we are printing a value that was declared outside initially one.

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,440
Then it became two.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,490
Then it became three.

53
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,200
Then we came to the next to begin four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12.

54
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,480
OK.

55
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,430
So four rows and three columns.

56
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,260
So this is going to feel it is going to print in this fashion.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,490
And after printing every row, we are going to come out of the inner loop and we are going to hit this

58
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:02,850
new line.

59
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,150
Correct?

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,440
OK.

61
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,600
So this is an example of an attitude, and you will required nested loops in some problems.

62
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,630
Let me show you the output as well so I can see.

63
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,320
Look, we have one errors.

64
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,570
This needs to be commented out.

65
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,560
So we have.

66
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,930
OK, let's for those entry columns.

67
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,090
I knew going to this is what we are getting, OK, loud protests, correct?

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,840
And this is what is expected from this particular program.

69
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,770
And I hope you understood this one as well.
