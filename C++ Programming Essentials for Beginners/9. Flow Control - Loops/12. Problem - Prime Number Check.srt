00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,240
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:06,160
In this lecture, we'll solve this problem given a number, and we want to check if it is a prime number

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,790
or not.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,730
So let's see how we can solve this problem.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,860
So any number is prime.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,980
It has only two dividers, that is one and the number itself.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,520
So talk about the number like 11 11 has only two dividers, one and 11 or knockabout.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,660
A number like seven seven has only two dividers, one in seven.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,800
But talk about the number like nine or 15 or 21.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,940
All these numbers they will have, at least one divides it in the range you do n minus one, you'll

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,090
get one and they are the dividers of every number.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,420
OK.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,160
That means if you need to find a device it, it must lie in the range.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,110
Starting from total and minus one to nine does have a device that is three.

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,480
And it lies in the range two, two and minus one.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,560
Similarly, 15 also has a divider in the range.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,590
It will do 14.

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,780
That is n minus one on the divider.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,940
You can see trees are divided, highways are divided.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,340
OK, so we need to find at least one divider in this range to prove a number is not right.

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:09,640
OK.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,750
So what do we need?

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,500
We need to.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,010
Find at least one device that.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,810
In the range it will do and minus one will prove a number is not.

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,010
And if we if we don't get to televise it, then it means it is a prime numbers.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,500
Let's see how we can solve this problem.

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,530
First of all, will create and will read what and is a now.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,200
Maybe we can put off our Lou, by the way.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,440
Then maybe we can say we'll start finding the divisor from do and we'll go till and minus one.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,810
And we are.

32
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,770
Trying to check if I is one possible by thereof.

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,310
And if not, I if this is equal to zero.

34
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,190
So what you can see, you can see that this number is not prime.

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:13,180
So you can say, you know, the number 10 is not prime and you can break, OK, that means you're going

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,850
to stop the look.

37
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,280
You don't need to go further.

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,190
For example, for the number 15, you take it as if you are to divide 15.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
And that is no.

40
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,720
You go to the next number, that is three.

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,670
The three divide 15.

42
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,960
And there is, yes.

43
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,880
So you don't need to check for the numbers four, five six up to 14 at this point only.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,020
You can say that 15 is not prime number or give you a pin is not a prime number.

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,380
Now, what is going to happen?

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,860
We also want to print when a number is prime or not, so the number would be prime if we reach here.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,970
But based upon a certain condition or based upon a certain condition.

48
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:59,190
So that condition would be if I has reached a value that is equal to and only in that case, we can

49
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,520
say the number end is a prime number.

50
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,470
No, why?

51
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,770
Why this is true.

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,090
Talk about a number like, let's say, seven, right?

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,400
So you started from two.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,510
So I became three.

55
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,340
Then I became four.

56
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,820
Right?

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,070
Then I became five and then I became six.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,590
So it does not divide seven three, does not divide seven four, does not divide seven five, does not

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,320
divide seven six, does not divide seven and you're doing 8+.

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,200
Finally, when you're not willing to stop.

61
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,120
I'm going to take the value seven.

62
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,900
And that means there are actually two ways to come to line number 18, right?

63
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,900
One ways you can buy the break statement.

64
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,160
OK, so if we can buy the break statement, the number is not prime.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,010
The number is not.

66
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,840
And if we don't come by the break statement, in that case, the number is prime.

67
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,230
In that case, the number is right.

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,640
So.

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,840
That's how you you can solve this problem of checking whether the number is prime or not.

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,410
So let me try to run this code and we'll show you in the demo, right?

71
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,960
So let's build a scoreboard first, so we have OK now we have got an error that is not declared.

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,830
So as I discussed, I is declared inside the blog scope of for loop so we can create this eye outside

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,630
and that will solve our purpose.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,350
Now, Isaac says, it will outside the loop as well, right?

75
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,330
And let us try to run this code for the number who find the body.

76
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,330
We have to run this file first.

77
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,920
Fifteen is not right.

78
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,710
And if I give the number seven, seven is prime 21, not prime 23.

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,620
It is prime, well, guess what that means this court is working as expected, and the only thing that

80
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,410
we need to know is that there are two ways in which we can end up bad outside the loop.

81
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,430
The once the loop is over, the value of I would be called when and if the loop breaks in between.

82
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,960
I will never reach the value that is equal to and in that case, the number is not OK.

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,410
If you don't put this check, this statement would be printed always, irrespective of number is prime

84
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:22,820
or not.

85
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,650
So that is why we're doing this check is important.

86
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,500
So I hope you have understood the logic, and that's all for this video.
