1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,140
Everyone in this body will talk about break and continue statements, which are also very important

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,610
in controlling the flow of the law.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,060
First, we will talk about the brake statement.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,680
Now think of a scenario you would in a gym on.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,900
You were trying to burn calories and your girlfriend called you in the middle of the workout and she

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,010
asked you to go for dinner.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,080
OK, so maybe you decide to stop the workout and you come out of that loop of running on the treadmill

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,470
and you decide to go for dinner, right?

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,660
So that is where the break statement is going to helpful.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,600
If you want to stop the loop in the middle of a workflow, that is where the break statement comes into

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,040
picture.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
So I'll show you one real example.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,190
So what?

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,530
We will write some code on.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,810
We'll try to simulate this condition of break.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,140
OK, so maybe break the mold out CPB and just to start with, maybe we can have some boilerplate code

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,770
and

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,050
Ant-Man.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:17,150
Now, maybe you go to the gym you started from zero calories on your target was to achieve I'm burning

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,190
like 230 calories.

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,310
So while calories less than equal or less than 30, you are maybe running on the treadmill.

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,860
Running, running on, maybe you can print how many calories you have burned.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,870
Maybe running and burning these many galleries.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,850
Now suppose at some point, maybe when 112 110 calories.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,970
Your girlfriend calls you up, so maybe will simulate this condition using this variable, their girlfriend

26
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,630
will call you up.

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,040
I 10 goals so you can check if the calories burned.

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,860
If this is equal to girlfriend calls up, that means I need to stop the workout.

29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,950
Okay, so I need to stop here.

30
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,420
So you going to break?

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,100
Otherwise you continue in your loop and you say, OK, read C++ because we are running, we are burning

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,670
galleries.

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,180
And finally, you can say out of the loop now there are two ways of coming out of the loop.

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,500
Once when this loop is over.

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,990
But in this loop, we have put a conditional statement that if this condition becomes true, we will

36
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,270
break this brake statement.

37
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,930
What it is going to do, it is going to take you out of the loop.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,810
When it is executed, OK, when it is executed.

39
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,160
Let me show you the output, and that would allow for more clarity to you.

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,770
So let us try to see this in action.

41
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,400
So.

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,450
Let's go ahead and try to run the break demo.

43
00:02:52,710 --> 00:03:00,540
So maybe now you can see we will run Intel one two three four five six seven eight nine 10.

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,800
And actually what we are doing, we're actually printing calories plus one, so maybe I should print

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,580
calories only.

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,230
And you can see that after burning ten calories, right?

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,690
We are out of the loop we'll give you.

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:22,740
We could not go till the end of the loop to complete the workout because when the value of calories

49
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,670
it became 10.

50
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,620
This condition became true and the break statement got executed.

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,740
So once the break statement hits, you come out of the loop, right?

52
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,180
So that is the significance of the break statement.

53
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,330
So anything that is written below the break statement, this will not get executed and you are out of

54
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,650
the loop, you're out of the loop.

55
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,920
You will end up out line number 18, right?

56
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,960
So I hope you understood why the break statement is sometimes it's going to be helpful and how it works

57
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,610
and its significance.

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,020
So that's all for this video.
