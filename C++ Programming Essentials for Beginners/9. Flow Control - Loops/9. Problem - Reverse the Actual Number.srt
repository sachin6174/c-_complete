1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,660
Everyone, so you've already seen given a number.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,000
How do we reverse it?

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,030
OK, and how do we print the digits of the number in the it was in this lecture, I'm going to show

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,310
you if you actually want to reverse the original number and what should be above reproach again.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,600
So for example, if I'm given a number like 123 and I want this end to be country 21.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,880
OK, so let's see, how do we do it?

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,440
If you look at 123 how it is made, it is made by combining these digits multiplied with certain powers

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,980
of ten.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,490
OK, so one is multiplied with 10 squared.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,630
It was multiplied with ten point one and three is multiplied with ten but zero and adding this hundred

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,860
plus twenty plus three.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,260
This makes the number 123 OK.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,100
And if you want to get the number 321, so you actually have to multiply three with 10 square two with

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,650
10 by one, one with ten point zero.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,860
And I think this would become 300 plus 20 plus one, leading to 321 right now, what we can do is we

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,250
have seen how do they extract digits and.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,690
But in the digital and reverse order, so instead of now just printing their digits, we are also going

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,480
to form a number.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
OK, so let's look at what we are going to do.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,330
Let me call this number as 123.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,260
And let me call this number, which is zero in the beginning as my answer to what I will do.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,600
I will extract the last digit and I will move the digit to the answer.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,630
OK, so I will say I will apply this operation.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,690
Answer equals answer into 10 plus the last digit that I'm getting.

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,210
Now you see the significance of this operation, OK?

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,980
Why it is important to in the first step, we get the digital three.

27
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,510
And the answer would become zero into 10 plus three and which is equal to three.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,800
OK, and will reduce this number by dividing it with 10 to end becomes 12, right?

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,800
So we segregate 12 and three.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,130
And this is what our answer is in the next step.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,270
I'm going to find out the last digit again to that last digit would be two.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,290
And my number would be reduced by end by then, which is No.

33
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:17,590
One.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,310
Now how do we combine this two with this three?

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,650
OK.

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,150
So effectively, I want this three to become 32.

37
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,980
So how it will become so it will do whatever is the correct answer.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,510
OK, so what will be multiplied with 10 to train to 10 makes it 30?

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,210
And we add the last digit to it.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,420
So it becomes a No.32, right?

41
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,690
Great.

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,020
So this is what we are actually trying to achieve next time.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,590
What you get.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,290
You will get the last digit, which is one, and you will reduce this number by dividing it with 10.

45
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,360
So it becomes zero, it becomes zero.

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,890
That's a good thing.

47
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,040
And now we have this reminder as one.

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,380
So what we want, we want to attach this one with 32.

49
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,830
So how do we attach one with 32?

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,970
So we have to multiply 32 with 10?

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,640
That is again, this operation.

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,200
Multiply your previous Andrew.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,130
It's 10, right?

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,080
And add.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
One, do it, so it becomes the number 321.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,830
And your original number is now zero.

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,330
And that means we can nonstop and you'll find a land that is now 321.

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,400
And that is what we wanted to get, right?

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,520
So how we will modify this code, so we'll keep one more bucket, that is answer that was initially

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,910
zero.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,510
And instead of printing the last digit, we will add this digit to our answered.

62
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,100
So answer would be answered in 210 plus last digit.

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,790
So this is a way of combining the last digit with the correct answer.

64
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,140
And again, we are reducing the number by a factor of 10.

65
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,590
So finally, what are you doing to put your link to output your answer, which is the reverse of the

66
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,690
actual number that you have got, right?

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,130
So we have built the code and now we are ready to test our code.

68
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:13,200
So maybe I can say it like it was actual device number actually.

69
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,490
Yes.

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,890
Yes.

71
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,880
So maybe one two three four I get four three two one.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,480
Great.

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:27,180
I have one zero zero one one zero zero one two two one zero zero one and if I have one.

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,500
And now you can do.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,920
In this case, the output is actually one.

76
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,630
It is not zero zero one.

77
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,480
Okay, so that is a difference between two approaches.

78
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,900
And here you are actually reversing the number, whereas in the previous one, you were only printing

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,320
the number.

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
OK, so reverse it.

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,010
Finally, if you want, you can do any word once it and you can talk.

82
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,420
I have reversed the actual number itself.

83
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,160
That is also OK.

84
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,910
So I hope you have understood how we can use a loop here.

85
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,270
OK.

86
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,670
You could even have used a for loop.

87
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,980
You could have said four and greater than zero and an equal to end by ten.

88
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,040
And I don't want to do this.

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,970
That's OK.

90
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,090
And you understood the last digit as end model is.

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,980
That is all talk.

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,820
So you can simplify this code for the by using the for loop.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,490
But it does not affect the execution time because what the loops have similar performance are now,

94
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,580
you will get the same output, but now we are using a four wheel.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,020
So I hope you have understood what these approaches and that's all.
