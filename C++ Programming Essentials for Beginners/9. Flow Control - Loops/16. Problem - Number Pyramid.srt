00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,850
Hello, everyone, and this lecture will try to solve another pardon problem, and the burden looks

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,720
something like this.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,970
And this is what we want to print for a given, and, for example, and his vote for this example.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,630
Let's try to break down this pattern like any other part and what what we'll do, we'll find out how

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,880
many roads we need to bring in this for.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,600
So we do see there are photos, the first row, the second row, the third row and the fourth right.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,500
And then we need to observe what we are doing in each row, right?

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,730
So the pattern actually starts from this part.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,550
OK, so this part is not considered OK.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,620
What we can observe is not if I talk about the rule number one.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,330
Rule number two, number three and four in each row.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,120
What I can, I can see some number of spaces.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,260
OK, then I have some number of numbers which are in the increasing order, and I do have some numbers

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,820
which are in decreasing order.

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,990
This is what we have and we will try to count how many such numbers are there, OK?

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,760
So if I talk about of all true, I have zero spaces.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,330
Third row, I have one space that can draw.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,900
I have two spaces and in the first row I do have three spaces.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,500
OK, so we know that and is for.

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,920
And while it's true, we have four miners, one that is today's best second, we have four miners,

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,700
two that is to space for miners, three that is one space and for miners for that.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,910
So again, is it in the eye it through?

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,360
I do have and minus Espaces.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,900
OK.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,670
It's a pure observation thing you can easily write and you can observe.

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,030
As the rule is increasing, the space is decreasing.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,990
So as I increases, the number of spaces would be from this one.

28
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,720
OK, then I have increasing numbers, so we have one that is in the increasing order.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,610
We have two numbers in the increasing order.

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,580
We have three numbers in the increasing order and we have four numbers in the increasing world.

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:05,940
OK.

32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,550
So basically one, two, three and four.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,280
Effectively, this is same as the rule number.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,960
So you have eight numbers in the increasing order, and they start from a value that is equal to the

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,610
number again, starting from.

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,970
Starting from a value that is equal to my.

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,240
That is that solves the problem for the increasing numbers as well, OK, then what are you going to

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,570
absorb?

39
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,760
We do have decreasing numbers, so here we don't have any numbers, so we have zero number of numbers

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,590
here.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,830
We have only one number.

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,650
All right.

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,680
Here we have two numbers.

44
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,560
All right.

45
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,830
And here we have three numbers.

46
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,350
OK, any relate?

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,860
This with the value of two countries is the data i.e. minus one numbers, which are in the decreasing

48
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,360
order and starting from the value that is actually one less than what we printed.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,430
Or so we printed.

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,890
Seven.

51
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,240
It starts from six.

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,160
We printed five.

53
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,860
It starts from.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,070
The bill will initialize the value correctly and will see how do we do this initialization correctly

55
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,320
while writing the code OK, so now we have the breakup and we can start building over code.

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:29,670
So maybe I can start from here again to me and maybe I should write the loops so and scene in.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,140
And maybe then I will.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,320
First right to look for rules, OK?

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,640
The in intake will the one I lived in equal to an A-plus plus.

60
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,800
Now we are inside Egypt.

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,050
All right.

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,660
So we want to repeat some work and we want to repeat the work for Egypt.

63
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,860
Also first work, we have to do four spaces, then we have to do it for increasing numbers and then

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
we have to do it for decreasing numbers.

65
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:05,990
OK?

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,640
The four spaces we have seen that we need to print and minus ibises.

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:18,650
Maybe I can say for our count, that is equal to one count place and equal to and minus I count plus

68
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:25,250
plus every time I want to put into space, this is going to print and minus eight spaces in the I through.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,580
We are Denver's business.

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,060
Then we have to print the numbers in the increasing order, so maybe Reagan to Ford and co. equal to

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,890
one count less than equal, do I?

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,090
Boundless bliss, this loop is going to run our times, and we know we need to print some value so that

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,620
value will begin from the true number itself.

74
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:56,560
So that is equal to I, and every time I'm printing a value again to see out value, I will increment

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,860
this value for the next iteration.

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,640
OK, so this will bring I numbers in the increasing order.

77
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,660
Then comes the decreasing numbers because of what we discussed.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,880
We need to re initialize or reassign the value so that we.

79
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,060
The correct value from where we want to operate, and then we say we want to print a minus one numbers

80
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,090
in the decreasing order, OK, so we are going to see how do we initialize this value and we'll print

81
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,080
the value and every time the value is decreasing by one value minus money.

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,980
Look, if the count is increasing because we want this look good on a minus one times the value that

83
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,180
we are printing, this value is going to reduce at every step.

84
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,020
So let us talk about the rule number three, right?

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,460
What happens?

86
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,220
You will get in row number three, the value starts from high and you run the slope items.

87
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,400
So that means you print three and the value becomes four.

88
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,930
You print four.

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,550
Undervalue becomes five.

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
You print five.

91
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,740
And the value in the memory it becomes six.

92
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,520
OK, so you are doing a value plus plus operation after printing every value.

93
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,460
That means you give you have printed the numbers in the increasing order and the value is no increments

94
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,050
to six.

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,100
But what is the next value that you would be printing, right?

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,040
So if you look carefully?

97
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,110
So you made four or five, you printed five and you made it.

98
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,030
If you look carefully in the part of the value that we wanted to print was four, right?

99
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,710
And then we wanted to print.

100
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,210
How do you reach this single forward from this value?

101
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,540
Six.

102
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,550
And this meant this values in the moment it's not printed, but it is dead in the memory because of

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,430
this update, right?

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,560
That means if you try to print the railroad, take this look.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
It would be six.

106
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,770
It would be not five.

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,580
It would be six.

108
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,410
And I want to get the villagers four.

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,280
So I have to do value equals two value minus two.

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,800
So I have to subtract two.

111
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,070
So that I get the correct value and now it should work.

112
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,490
And after every rule, we have to go to new lengths of illiteracy out and.

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,860
And that's it.

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,750
I should solve our problem.

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,170
You know, maybe I will include the header file so that I can run the code.

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,790
And let's build it.

117
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,380
Illustrated to it.

118
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,900
The name is Pyramid.

119
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,690
And as for so I get this pardon, which is absolutely correct.

120
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,570
And if it is five, I get the Spartan, which is also correct, OK?

121
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,370
So I hope you have understood this logic.

122
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,940
So I will just give you a quick recap of what we are trying to do.

123
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,380
The first, we tried to break down the button along the rows, and in each row we see that as a component

124
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,130
of spaces.

125
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,390
There is a component of increasing numbers and there is a component of decreasing numbers in each component.

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,280
We are doing some work that is getting repeated and we are printing some value that needs to be initialized

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,790
correctly.

128
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,970
Again, these are the two initial positions that we have done, and the values also need to update for

129
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,190
increasing numbers.

130
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,750
It is a plus pleasure and for decreasing numbers.

131
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,790
It is a minus minus upgrade.

132
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,570
And after every rule, we have to go to new line.

133
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,170
And why don't we put it down?

134
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:38,650
OK.

135
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,830
So I hope this makes your concept of loop more quiet, and that's all for this video.
