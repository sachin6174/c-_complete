1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,140
Everyone, so you have seen the statement, the next statement that is used in changing the flow of

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,780
control of loop is known as continuous statement.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,890
So as the name suggests, it is going to ask the loop or you start kind of continuing from the next

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,550
iteration, OK?

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,750
So what happens when you hit this continue statement inside the loop?

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,780
The control flow, everything that is written below this continues statement.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:34,070
It is going to get skipped and it is going to return to the next iteration will get basically what what

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,430
this example is showing that the galleries were zero and we wanted to run this loop when galleries were

9
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,570
less than 20 and when galleries is 15.

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,160
I'm doing galleries equal to galleries plus one.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,630
So basically what is happening is.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,260
We are actually skipping this step.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,870
We are skipping sealed calories, that means we are not going to print it and we are also doing this

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,680
step calories equal.

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,560
Look at this place when this is important, so I will explain you through really good what is going

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,980
to happen.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,280
So continue will take you to the beginning of the loop and I'm going to screen you how it is going to

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,510
work.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,320
OK, so maybe a new example and again, to continue the CBB.

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,390
So we are not going to use a break.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:29,620
So maybe if calories equal to some number, it save calories mod five if it does zero right, if calories

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:37,240
is a multiple of five, I don't want to print calories, so I can maybe put this statement out, right?

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,540
So, so maybe I want to print laden.

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,160
And I want to increase the number of calories by one, and I'm going to continue, right?

25
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,070
So effectively what we are trying to say.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,000
So every time we hit a multiple of five, we are not going to print the calories.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,860
We are just going to print well-done and we're going to say, continue.

28
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:10,300
OK, so now let's try to execute this code and try to see what is going to happen.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,080
In this case, though, the shoulders continue them right now.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,480
Initially this well, then maybe I should also put right.

31
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,700
That would be a little better.

32
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,310
And let me make this as 20.

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:37,490
So that we get some more space on the screen, so I get laden running and burning one two three four

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,040
rather, then six seven eight nine Velden 11, 12, 13, 14 very, then 16, 17, 18 19.

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,080
And as soon as we hit 20, we are out of the loop, right?

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,520
So this is the significance of continued statement.

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,880
So what it is doing now, in the beginning, we had zero and this condition is true.

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,970
We a very then and you increase the number of calories you go to one.

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,170
So we print very learned into this one.

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,050
The condition is not true.

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,600
We come here and we are running and burning.

42
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,360
So one.

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,810
Similarly, we print two three four.

44
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,520
Again, we hit five five five five zero.

45
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,540
We print well.

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,580
Then we increase the number of calories.

47
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,590
Now this is a very important step here.

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,680
If you don't do this, what is going to happen?

49
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:33,390
If you suppose you forget to obey orders and maybe you're starting from one to what is going to happen

50
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,870
at one, you print or get ending and burning and you go to two running and burning, three running and

51
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,780
burning for running and burning at five.

52
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,890
What are you going to do?

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,080
You are going to print very then and continue.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,270
So when you go back here, right?

55
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,210
So what is the value of calories?

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,890
It is still five and five is less than 20.

57
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,450
So again, you come here, you print, well done, well done, varied and varied and varied.

58
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,560
And this loop is going to run for a finite number of times that is going to cost your program to crash.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,670
So it is not recommended that you use the Continue statement without updating this variable, which

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,580
is controlling the execution of the loop.

61
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,170
So this must be updated so that our loop also finishes.

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,870
So if I show you the demo now, we will see this program will get stuck.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,420
And it is actually printing well done, a lot of things in finite times, it's still running.

64
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:33,980
OK.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,350
It's still running.

66
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,140
You can see on the right.

67
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,400
So we will stop it and we'll suspend it.

68
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,030
OK.

69
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,700
And we have suspended the program.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,440
We have to stop it explicitly by giving a keyboard interrupt.

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,820
And then it stopped.

72
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,730
OK, so this will lead to infinite loop.

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,200
So I'll just make a note.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,520
Don't forget this statement.

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,760
Otherwise, you will end up, you know, in finite loop.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,320
OK.

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,820
That is the significance of continued.

78
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,630
Now you may ask, why can't we do this using if it's not and there is, of course you can, continues

79
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,210
one more concept that we wanted to teach.

80
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,160
That is why we took this example.

81
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,280
Otherwise, feel free to do this using it felt as well.

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,800
That will work perfectly fine in this case.
