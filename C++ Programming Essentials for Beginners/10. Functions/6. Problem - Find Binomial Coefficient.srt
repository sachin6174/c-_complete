1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,040
Everyone in this lecture, we're going to see how do we compute the binomial coefficient INSEAD, given

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
the value of and not?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,260
OK.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,050
So we would be given and and we would be given out and we want to compute INSEAD.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,410
OK.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,920
The nearest denoted as the binomial coefficients.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,090
I will tell you an example.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:29,090
Let's say you have five cards and the name of the cards are a, b, c, d e or you want to choose Dugard's

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,880
within the binomial coefficient tells us in how many ways we can select Dugard's.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,300
Out of lifeguards, OK?

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,040
What problems like these?

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,370
Either we make all the possible combinations, for example, I choose the guard Abby or I choose the

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,260
guard AC or I choose Eddie or I choose a night.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:59,470
Or I choose B C, B D, we e but I choose C, B B or I choose the.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,290
Okay, so clearly how many ways we are, it is four plus three plus two plus one, which is 10 ways.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,550
Either you make all the possible combinations and then you compute the other ways to use the binomial

17
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,570
option in zero in this case and is five.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,950
And how many objects we own the juice out of N objects do.

19
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,760
We will compute 5C to get two entities denoted as n Victorian, divided by and minus are factorial.

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:36,160
In do our federal let us try to put this formula for 5C to so it is five factorial five minus two,

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,590
that is three Victoria into our victory letters to Victoria.

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:46,390
Now this five actually can be written as three victories in the vote in the five so that we can cancel

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,530
out three factorial.

24
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,810
And here we are left with two Victoria with just two to the vote by Tuesday night.

25
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,690
Either you use this formula in theory or you generate all possibilities obviously generating and yet

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,990
is more convenient to us and we can get the answer.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,180
By just computing the binomial opportunity, this is what the significance of binomial coefficient is,

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,040
what we are doing.

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,840
We are going to write a function that compute the binomial coefficient for us.

30
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,880
Let us try to do that.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,650
Will right and not we will take input and they're not.

32
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:32,960
That means we want to choose in how many ways we can choose our objects out of a set off an object.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,130
So for that, we're going to compute the binomial coefficient.

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:45,700
Given and not right, so clearly, we will write a function that returns an integer, right?

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,560
So in binomial coefficient, we get in, then indeed and now how we're going to do it right.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,690
So we know that the onthat is in Victoria divided by and minus odd factorial.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,320
And what victory late, so maybe I can answer is.

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,470
And Victoria divided by n minus advertorial in dour Victorian, right?

39
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,450
And this goes in denominator.

40
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,680
One thing is very clear that here is some work, which is repetitive.

41
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,620
That means we need to compute Victoria repeatedly.

42
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,880
What would be a better idea?

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,680
So you can make a stand alone function for factorial like we have already done will reduce that go ahead.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,890
And that called that function is going to be used three times in this example.

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,190
So and there would be factorial of and divided by factorial off and minus are.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,310
Into Victoria Law.

47
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,640
I nodded and reconsidered and answered.

48
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:57,640
This actually simplifies our code of binomial confusion a lot because we don't need to compute and victory

49
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,750
here, here, here.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,220
So all of these calculations are burdened by a function which is a reusable block of code.

51
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,550
OK, so it is reusable.

52
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,610
We can use it three times in this computation, and it is going to work for us.

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,350
Let us try to run this code and see what do we get right?

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,370
So we have built the code.

55
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,340
And now I can run and dodge large binomial coefficient.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,300
And let's end as five artists do, so I get done today.

57
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,660
OK?

58
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,140
How about 63 if and in six areas?

59
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,330
Three I you're done to 20 years working perfectly fine for all of these cases.

60
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,190
And I hope now you've understood that functions are indeed helpful.

61
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,500
And that's all for this video.
