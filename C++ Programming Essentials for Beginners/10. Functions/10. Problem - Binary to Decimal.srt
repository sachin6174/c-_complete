00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,300
Everyone's in this lecture, we're going to solve this problem.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,920
We are given a number and which is having binary digits, that means zeros and ones.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,030
We want to interpret this, interpret the decimal equivalent of this.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,780
Basically, we need to write a function that converts.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,360
A number from binary to decimal rate.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,380
So we are getting some number, which is in the form of zeros and ones.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's see how we can do it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,120
So if the number is, let's say, one one zero one, you know how to interpret this number, right?

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,660
So we know that this number is made up of powers of two.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,010
So this is two par zero.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,250
This is two about one.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,230
This is two squared.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,000
And those two will get in simpler terms.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,900
These bars are one, two, four and eight and we are going to multiply the corresponding powers.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,360
And these digits?

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,210
It is eight plus four plus zero plus one.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,700
So this number is nothing but the number 13.

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,520
So that is what we want to find out to how we're going to do it in order to do this.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,240
What we need is we need to extract all the digits, mate.

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,510
So first, we will extract the last digit that we know it is easy.

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,080
How do we get the last digit too busy, last digit of any number?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,300
It is involved.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,540
10.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,290
All right.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,460
We got the last digit.

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,210
You need to multiply this with some power.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,130
So initially the power is one that is to power zero eight.

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,240
OK.

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,500
So, OK, it will multiply this last digit with some power, and we will add it to do an answer.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,220
So answer equal to 200 plus last digit into Zimbabwe power.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,280
And that power was initially one eight.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,020
The power was initially one.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,180
And our answer was initially zero, but this this thing, we have to do it for every place we get.

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,870
That means once we are done with this place, we have to move to the next place.

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,820
How do we go to the next place?

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,460
We need two things.

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,770
I need to find out the last digit promised millennium.

38
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,330
That means I need to reduce my number by a factor of 10.

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,300
OK, that will remove the last digit.

40
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,520
And I also need to increase my power from 2.0 to two per one.

41
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,680
That means the power is getting multiplied with two.

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,020
I have to say power equals two power, and I keep wondering this is OK.

43
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,450
I added one in the.

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,400
One to my answer, and there is one next time I will add what I will add something to my answer, which

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,540
is zero into two that is still one standard is still one.

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,040
This is also gone.

47
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,630
Next time, I'm going to put everything inside the loop right next time, the next digit is this number

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,260
11.

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,070
The last digit is one, and the previous answer is one.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,040
So is it one plus one into the next ballot every time the power is getting multiplied with two?

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,120
So this power is for one in two four.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,670
OK, so this number becomes five.

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,830
We're going to we have processed these three digits and equal in number.

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,120
We have got this till now.

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
It is five, right?

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,890
Next time, we're going to remove this using an equal one button.

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,950
So the number that is left as one, the last digit, it would be also one.

58
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,170
So easy answer equal to under plus five plus the ballot.

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,670
The power is going to be eight when we go to the next position.

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,910
Last digit in the power.

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
So the last digit is one into eight eight.

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,520
We add eight plus five, that is not 13 and we discard this off.

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,280
Finally, what is left?

64
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,510
So we have these birds with Detlev and they represent the number zero.

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,170
So what we can see, while the number is not equal to zero or while the number is greater than zero.

66
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,530
What we are doing, we are going to find out the last digit.

67
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,120
Multiplied with suitable power of two at that position.

68
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,930
And for a bit, we are going to update two things.

69
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,290
One is the power as we are going to the next index or the next place, the power of two gets double

70
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,880
eight and the number itself gets reduced by a factor of 10 because we are removing one digit rate.

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,960
And finally, from there, we considered under and said now we can dig and put some number and begin

72
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,110
to see out binary to decimal and the number is this.

73
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,280
OK.

74
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,660
OK, we got some go into last digit.

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,010
All right.

76
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,980
Now the belt is successful and let me show you show it to you, right?

77
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,260
Binary to decimal.

78
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,710
OK, let's say the number is one zero zero.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,100
So it is actually the number four one zero one.

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,530
It is five one one zero one.

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,550
It is 13.

82
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,090
And how about this number one zero one zero one one one zero one zero one one?

83
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,860
The number is 43.

84
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,660
OK, so our code is working fine for all the cases, and I hope you have understood this logic and that's

85
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,560
all for this video.
