00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,100
Everyone's in this lecture, we're going to look at the concept of default parameters or default parameter

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,590
values, which we can give you any barometer.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,320
For example, we have this method to play music and we are now sending song ideas from here, right?

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,520
What we can, we can also give some default value to us all night.

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,520
OK, so let me show you through a real working example.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,520
Maybe let's copy this code and let's create a new.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,380
By default values, but if you.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,690
And we will let me just copy this one as well, right?

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,970
Now what we are going to do, we have seen that we can easily call the play music function without ending

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,660
any barometer.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,050
One thing we can do is we can send some song I.D. and we can ask this to play this song with this I.D.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,310
eight.

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,420
Now, this, if I believe, is called it will give me an error that there is no margin function, call

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,520
OK, so whenever you are calling this function, it requires you to send at least one parameter.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,280
But in the function call, we are not sending any parameter right.

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,050
We have to give some numbers, maybe later.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,410
Five.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,800
And now if I build this code, it is going to be fine.

19
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,460
OK?

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,440
And what I can do is I can try to show you the output in this case.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,820
Functions as the default values guide, so you can see that it's playing music with Song I.D., that

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,620
is five as expected.

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,010
And what I can do, I can see the default song or it is one.

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,270
Now what does it mean?

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,100
It basically means that this function now can be called in two ways.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,090
The first is without giving any.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,420
Barometer, OK.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:05,100
And the second is by giving one song aid, for example, if I go call this function, play play music

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,400
and they don't specify any parameters, so what is going to happen?

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,370
The song lady is going to assume a default value of one, or maybe anything like three, something like

31
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,700
that.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,960
Now, if I call this function, you will see it, says playing music three and playing music five.

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,480
What is happening in this case when we are sending this is the default.

34
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,360
Get over it and it gets the song, it becomes five.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,710
And if I don't play anything by default, the song Ideas No.

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,080
Three, OK, so that is what is the concept of default values, right?

37
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,370
Maybe you're going to have another song idea which is let the song lady do.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,620
And that is having a default value of six.

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,180
And maybe I can do something like this.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,640
Play music and this song idea to write on, maybe you can just put it here on Song I.D. That is also

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,030
fine.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,920
Now, if I call the first function, it will work as as expected, so it will say, OK, those playing

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,400
music with Song 83 and Song 86 because we are not sending any parameters to both of these would assume

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
their default values.

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,900
Let's use output.

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,410
Sorry.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,840
Uh, no.

48
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,880
We should have records in eight.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,820
To playing music with three and six on in the second case, when you're sending only five.

50
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,970
So in that value will go into the first barometer hit, we'll get that value will go hit on Song I.D.

51
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,200
one would become five and Song I.D. two will will remain six.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,690
It will say playing music five and six.

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,590
That is what you're getting at playing music.

54
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,430
Vibrant, right?

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,060
And there is one more way not now to call this function by giving those young ladies right so I can

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,180
do.

57
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,790
No, I want to play music for the songs one, zero one and one zero two.

58
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,840
That is also fine, not this function.

59
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,720
We have two default parameters and this function now can be called in three different ways without no

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,150
barometer with one parameter on which two mandatory like parameters.

61
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,350
OK, now if I run this one again, now you can do playing music with one zero one and one zero two to

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,090
both these song IDs.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,120
They get overridden by the values that we have supplied from the inside the function call OK.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,150
So I hope you kind of understood the concept of default parameters, and that's all for this video.
