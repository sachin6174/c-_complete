1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,880
Everyone in this lecture will solve a problem, given a number, and we want to find the binary representation

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,570
of that number.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,280
So let's recall what we discussed about how do we convert the number into its binary.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:19,750
So let's say we have a number 43, the one technique that we discussed when we talked about the binary

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,230
number system that we have to repeatedly divide this number by two.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:32,040
And every time we have to write the ocean and remained so doing, 221 is 42 and the remainder is one,

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,900
OK, go into 10 is 20 and the remaining terrestrial one within the five is 10.

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,110
And that even president doing due to his food and the remainder is one it wouldn't do, one is to.

9
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:53,200
And the remainder is zero and two into zero zero under him in this one.

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,440
OK.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,970
This is what.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,730
And this and this is what the remainder is.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,930
And what we discussed that if you interpret these numbers from bottom to top, they will give you the

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,460
binary representation of dog.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,020
And you can verify all this is to par zero one two four eight 16 32, effectively adding 32 plus eight

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,160
plus two plus one.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,950
And this gives you the number 43.

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,980
That means this long division method really works.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,710
And given this, you can convert any number into its binary representation.

20
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:29,920
OK?

21
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,230
Now getting the remainder this easy right?

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,620
So what we are actually doing is we have a number in with us and we want to write a function.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,860
That gives us the binary representation letter that is also an integer, right?

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,300
Maybe I say a decimal to binary is the function name, and it accepts indeed.

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,140
And returns are indeed of this form, right integer, which is made using zeros and ones.

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,340
Right now, what I need to see is that when you're combining these numbers right?

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,290
So effectively, if I talk about this number or any number, it's a let's do it for a simpler number,

28
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,590
such as Letter nine, right?

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,880
How do you do it for nine?

30
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
So you say it will do four is eight and the remainder is one.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,560
The window two is for the remainder zero two into one is to the remainder is zero and two and two zero

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:26,910
zero.

33
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,450
And remember this one, this one zero zero one.

34
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,820
This gives us the binary representation of the number 98.

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,230
The one thing to note is that.

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,850
We can easily get the reminders or we can easily get the reminders.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,600
But the challenge is how do we form the no, OK, how do we form this number one zero zero one effectively

38
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,350
what we need to do, we need to multiply this reminder.

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,920
Because it is coming.

40
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:03,430
It is multiplied with 10 by one zero zero is coming, yet it is multiplied with 10 power one.

41
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,230
This zero is coming.

42
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,360
It is multiplied with 10 squared.

43
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,730
And this one is coming out, so it is multiplied with 10.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,520
OK, so if you add all of these domes, which is one plus zero plus zero plus 1000, it actually makes

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,070
the number one thousand one right now.

46
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,970
What does it mean as you're generating remainders down the line?

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,450
What do you need to?

48
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,920
You also need to generate powers of 10, starting from 10 biocidal and per one and squared and guilt,

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:40,900
and you need to multiply those powers with the remainder and you need to add them went on to right.

50
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,970
That is what you need to do.

51
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,730
Only then you can get a number of is of this form, right?

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,790
What I'm going to let us see how do we get the remainders first?

53
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,930
Into I have an answer, which is a sum of terms, and it is currently zero.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,410
I have some power of 10, which is 10 power zero eight.

55
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,040
And this is actually one and I can do while this number and eight.

56
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,810
So this is your number and we are doing some work while this and is greater than zero.

57
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,200
OK.

58
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,140
So while this end is greater than zero, what we are doing, we are always finding the remainder.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
OK, we remainders and models to.

60
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,960
Well, guess we get this one, this one, right?

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,520
And we multiply this remainder with the power in order to overrun what we see under equal 200 plus power

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,660
in the remainder.

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,800
All right.

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,450
What is the next step?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,790
We have to reduce the value of it.

66
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,800
We got the remainder.

67
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,990
We have to reduce this nine to four.

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,600
So easy and equal and divided by two.

69
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,230
So this but forms the update step of the loop.

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,580
But we have to do one more step as we are going down.

71
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,330
We have also played.

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,510
We have to update the power as well, right?

73
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:05,250
So we have to say that after the computing done to make power 10 times of the previous power.

74
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,100
So this is going to generate us the powers of then the remainders we are already getting.

75
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,450
And this is the main step we we are updating the answer by multiplying the remainder with relevant power.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,290
Often those are both the output would have been, let's say, one one zero one.

77
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,000
This one was multiplied with one.

78
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,820
This zero was multiplied with 10.

79
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,100
This was multiplied with 10 squared eight.

80
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,810
And this was multiplied with 10Q, adding these dumps would actually make the number one one zero one

81
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,050
night.

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,480
Now what you can do, you can see they're done.

83
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,340
The answer that is going to be the binary representation of this number.

84
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,130
And so you're going to see out there similar to binary.

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,970
And you give the number, then let's run this code.

86
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,140
So maybe I can say decimated by injury.

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,240
It said the number is 43, so I get one zero one zero one one.

88
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,410
Perfectly fine.

89
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,540
I say the number is 13.

90
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,800
Perfectly fine if being all one's fine.

91
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,120
The number is 100.

92
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,080
Look, this is how it looks like in binary.

93
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,260
And you can see that we have solved this problem.

94
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,710
So I hope this is clear and you the next we do.
