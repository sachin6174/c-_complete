Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to discuss a very basic mathematical problem, we need

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,710
to write a function to check whether a number is prime or not, OK?

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,680
So let's recall what is a prime number?

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,460
Prime number is a number which has only two devices.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,850
That is the one and the number itself.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,450
OK.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,690
For example, if I talk about the number seven, then seven has only two devices one and the number

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,380
itself, OK.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,280
That means in from the range 2.2 and minus one.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,120
OK.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,870
And if you have a number and then none of the numbers is going to divide.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,380
OK, so none of these.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,460
Is going to.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,210
Divide.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,150
And if this is the case, then we said the number and is going to be prime.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,350
Otherwise, it does not.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,100
That means if for a given number, if you find any one device there in the range, it will do and minus

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,370
one.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,430
That would mean the number is not prime.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,400
OK, if if I have led to this number is eight.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,880
If somehow and mortality, I is equal to zero, that means the number is not prime.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,240
OK.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,120
What we can do, we can begin on.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,870
But maybe let's say the number is 11.

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,730
Then will I read from the range?

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:34,000
It will do then two three four five six seven eight nine and then we will try to divide 11 with all

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,870
of these numbers.

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,320
And if no one divides 11, then we will see this number is prime.

29
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,800
But let's say the number is 12, the number is 14.

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,490
OK.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,060
Then we know that two is going to divide this number and we are going to say 14 two is divisible by

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,390
two.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,270
And hence this number is not right.

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:52,930
OK.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,920
So very simple.

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,480
But we will.

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,890
I dread over the range for, let's say, I in range.

38
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,680
It's a.

39
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,640
So we are going to say, OK, if I will go from two.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,690
I'll start from two.

41
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,690
It will go till in minus one.

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:24,960
And if somehow and more say if this becomes equal to zero, that means we can done that.

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,270
This number does not bring what we consider done for us.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,070
And if we come out of the loop, OK, if we come out of the loop, that means no written statement was

45
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,460
hit, then we can return it.

46
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,330
So this is what we are doing do.

47
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,290
So the would look something like this, and let's see the code in the next few.
