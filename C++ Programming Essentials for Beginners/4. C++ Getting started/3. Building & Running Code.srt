1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,930
Everyone in this lecture, we're going to write this code in our program and we are going to build it

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,770
and run it.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,860
First of all, you need a few of your things.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,430
You need a text editor to write the code that you can download.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,500
So we would be using sublime text.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,370
It's very lightweight and very cool that I personally like a lot.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,390
You can go with any other options as well as per your wish on taking those you need to install a C++

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,960
compiler.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,780
I will attach the links in the description, and when you're done with the two things what you need

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,930
to do, you need to open up your extruder, which is which would look something like this.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:49,720
And you need to save your fight, look, so if I tell you I saved as file as maybe a loader CPB, OK,

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,950
so or maybe hello world or TPP.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,210
This will create a new file.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,210
You can store it anywhere, any director you want.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,110
And we are going to type the same thing that we have seen in the boilerplate code, you will say, using

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,850
namespace today.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,450
And after that, we are going to create the mean that is the entry point of the program.

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,970
And we are also going to define the exit of the mean that is written zero.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,670
It signifies that the program has successfully terminated anything.

20
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,230
Any good idea of right.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,030
That logic will go ahead.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:35,440
If you want to print something well in C++, we will use this syntax C out, followed by the value that

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,130
you want to print.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,800
So maybe I want to print a very simple string.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,370
Hello.

26
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,460
So string goes inside the barcodes, followed by end to end.

27
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,910
It is like a new line.

28
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,590
I want to shift to the new line.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,270
So for that, we use in here.

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,450
And so these.

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:01,930
These things are this is an operator, OK, is this is actually a left shift operator, but it it it

32
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,870
has a special meaning for the compiler or get a compiler, understand these operators and these keywords

33
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,710
as per the rules of the C++ programming language.

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:17,950
So in the next set of videos, we are going to understand these rules, these new keyboards, what are

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,820
water functions?

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,200
What are variables?

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,990
So we are going to look at everything in detail.

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,320
But for now, we are just trying to show you how to write a very simple code on how you can run this

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,460
on your machine.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,290
So now what happened is we have the source code.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,470
OK, we have the source code with us.

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,930
So this file, this is known as source code.

43
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,180
There is a piece of application that we have installed on this system.

44
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,610
So that is known as a C++ compiler.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:02,370
We have a C++ compiler on the C++ compiler itself is a complex thing to understand what we are going

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,480
to do in this lecture.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,580
We're going to see at high level what is going to happen.

48
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:14,940
So it is going to accept a source file, which is a of TPP, and it is going to produce an executable

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,240
file.

50
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:24,840
May maybe something like Halo Dot, Eggsy if you are on a Windows machine or something like Halo out

51
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,830
if you're on.

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,230
A magic machine, something like this.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,830
What we're going to do, it will give us a file.

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,430
These files can be executed.

55
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,300
We need to run these files, OK?

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,630
We need to run these files.

57
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,420
The first step is compile the code.

58
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:52,800
The compilation process will give us an executable as an end output, and we need to run that file and

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,810
that will show us the output of the program, so it is a two step process.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,080
OK, so first step is building the code, which includes some violation and the second step is executing

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,470
the code.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,870
That means we are going to run this code.

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,900
So every program we are going to perform these two steps.

64
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,490
I'm going to show you these steps through a command line.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,770
So what you need to do, you need to open up terminal and you need to go to the location where you are.

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,570
So, for example, currently led to be at home to other quarters in the desktop world and inside CBB

67
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,050
lecture.

68
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,350
We come here and you do the command that we use to change that entry.

69
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,040
And inside this directory, if I do less alert means tell me what all files do we have?

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,590
OK, so it creates it has a file called Hello World Dog CBB.

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,760
OK.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,070
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to build this code and show you the output.

73
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,530
So let us see how to use the C++ compiler, OK?

74
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,550
So there is a command that is known as D-plus Plus.

75
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,390
So you hit the D-plus Plus is a command that invokes the Jianyu C++ compiler.

76
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,240
Jianyu C++ compiler.

77
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,880
This compiler gets invoked.

78
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,080
And this needs to be installed on your machine.

79
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,470
This this piece of software gets invoked when you write this command deeply if you want to see what

80
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,210
version of Duplicitous, I'm using.

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:38,280
You can see this is these are the details of the compiled ways and you get so you can see this version

82
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,810
is twelve point zero and so on.

83
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:47,910
And this is for this particular hardware that my machine has been being you using, OK?

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,090
So you can install any version that maybe is the latest version of the previous version.

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Totally up to you.

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,630
So what we are doing, we are going to use D-plus Plus to give our source file and create a executable

87
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:03,870
file.

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,290
So I'm going to say and C++, Hello world.

89
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,860
DOD CPB.

90
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,320
Now what happens this command executed successfully, and if I a list now?

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,590
There is a file called 8Ot out.

92
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,110
This is the default name of the file that has been created by our compiler.

93
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,760
And if I want to run this file, I have to say dodged like it or not.

94
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,760
This is how I compiled the file.

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,320
So this step is, is the compilation think that this is, uh, compile?

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:49,090
And this step is actually about executions, the law and order underscored again and underscored here,

97
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,570
if I press and enter now, you can see the output.

98
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,390
Hello, world.

99
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:01,330
I suppose I want to change my code and instead of saying hello world, I want to say hello everyone.

100
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,510
So what I will do, I will go back to my it and I will look.

101
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,710
Hello, everyone.

102
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:17,590
And again, back to the terminal, if I again run this good, I will not see any change because I have

103
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:26,590
not completed the compilation converts your source code into machine good orders, resin in the executable

104
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,570
file and that is run by the machine.

105
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,360
So what we need to do if we want to reflect the new output, we have to build our code again.

106
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,740
So we'll see D-plus Plus Hello World Dot A.P.B and laser dot like a dot.

107
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,970
OK, so now you can see the output is a lovely one.

108
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,580
OK.

109
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,600
And this is going to run your code on.

110
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,490
You see the output that has been updated as opposed.

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:01,060
If you want to rename your output file, you don't want the output file to look like you wrote out you

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,930
want something else.

113
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,760
So in that case, this d-plus plus except certain flags, so you can still get the name of the output

114
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,130
file.

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,180
It should be something else.

116
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,060
It should be hollowed out out instead of or maybe.

117
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,160
Hello, everyone got out.

118
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,790
And I'm going to compile the file.

119
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,850
Hello, World Dot CPB.

120
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm going to compile the file Helloworld or TPP, not if I do it less.

121
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,230
What are you going to hit?

122
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,780
There is a file that has been created.

123
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,490
Everyone thought out.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,250
So what we have said that the name of the executable file, it should not be rolled out.

125
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,390
It should be.

126
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,710
Hello, everyone.

127
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,140
No doubt we have specified.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,470
A flag, and we are telling that again, the output should be this one, and it should not be the default

129
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,970
one, which is not or.

130
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,720
And here it is our source file.

131
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,870
And with this flag, we have defined what should be the value of it.

132
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,730
Output file.

133
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,930
So in this case, if you want to run discord now, you will not be using large, large adulthood.

134
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,750
You should be using torchlight.

135
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,610
Hello, everyone.

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,840
Dot Dot.

137
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,060
OK, now you see the output.

138
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,810
Hello, everyone.

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,350
That is a slight introduction to how do you build and run a code using a C++ compiler?

140
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,590
And I hope you clearly understood these steps, and the compilation itself is a complex thing.

141
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,110
So we will spend one with you on diving deep into the details of the compilation process.

142
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,790
That's all for this video.

143
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,330
Thank you.
