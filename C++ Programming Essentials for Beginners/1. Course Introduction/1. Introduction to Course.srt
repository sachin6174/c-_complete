00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,810
And welcome to this course on C++ essentials, and I'm very excited to welcome you on congratulations

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,750
on taking the first step into the world of programming.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,550
So my name is pretty.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,890
I've been a software engineer at Google.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,730
I have co-founded two tech startups, including coding minutes.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,280
I work with scalar academy as well.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,300
And I've been instructor on Udemy for about one year now.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,910
And if you want to learn more about me, so I created an interactive portfolio resumÃ© website on that

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,200
igniting dot com, which you can visit and look at my journey of learning coding.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,420
When did I start and what did I achieve?

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,000
So before we dive into the specific details, I would like to share my perspective on learning to code

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,680
on becoming a problem solver.

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:58,050
What we do is I break down the step into three parts, like the first step of learning programming is

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,280
learning to hold the knife.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,350
What does it mean?

16
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,600
Get them translated with a real world analogy so that if you're a beginner, you understand the flaw

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,800
in a better sense, right?

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,030
The first step is always to learn to work with the programming language.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,030
So programming language is our tool and will try to get comfortable with the programming language in

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,660
this course.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,080
Once you're comfortable, the next step is you learn to use the knife by cutting a fruit.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,320
It means you learn how to solve a problem and what solving problems you need something.

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,920
Already the researchers, which are basically the containers that you need to store data on, you need

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,850
to learn algorithms which are basically their techniques to solve the problem, OK?

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,530
So then in the next step, you will learn about data centers an algorithm.

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,110
And the third step is, once you have learned to work with the researchers algorithms, you have to

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,140
apply them to newer kind of problems.

28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,000
OK, so this is what is also observed in many interviews.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,040
So you would be given a problem statement, which would be a newer, unseen problem, and it can be

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
a problem inspired from real world.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,290
For example, you want to find the nearest hospital, or maybe you want to devise a route for the cab,

32
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,640
which works in a sharing model, something like that.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,130
So the third step is about sharpening your knife and you have to cut your kind of route.

34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,940
So that is one step ahead of these three steps.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,320
I have created a problem solving track, and this is the first course of the track where you get comfortable

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,010
with the programming language in the next course, which is on data centers.

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,770
You learn how to work with different containers and their time complexities as well.

38
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,590
And in the third step, you learn how to sharpen your skills, how do you sharpen your knife and applied

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,830
algorithmic techniques to different type of problems, OK?

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:01,170
And so that's why I have devised three courses so that you go from zero to hero in in your journey of

41
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,070
solving problems.

42
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,490
I will be there in all three courses to help you the must become the master of problem solving.

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,180
And yeah, that is the problem solving track for you.

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,480
So before we discuss about this course, let me also tell you a little bit more about my professional

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,050
experience.

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,080
I've created several top rated online courses on did great coding minutes to bring high quality courses

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,650
on Udemy.

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,440
And a lot of my students who have gone through this journey of problem solving with me.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,500
They're working in top product companies, including startups and companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
as well, right?

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,450
So what to expect after this course?

52
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,890
So I'm just going to talk about this course, so you'll get comfortable with the programming language.

53
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,940
It does not matter which programming language you start with, it can be C++.

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
It can be deployed, can be Python.

55
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:00,840
But for this course, I've picked C++ as the language, and it helps you to get into more details of

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,760
how the programs work, what happens at the binary level and all that stuff.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,210
We do go in this course and you build solid programming foundations annually, radiological thinking

58
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,640
skills which are required to take the next step.

59
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,850
And you'll get familiar with concepts like loops, branching is string through cohesion, back dragging

60
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,150
on with masking and loops will cover these.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,890
You can have a detailed look at the curriculum, right?

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,340
The first part is the logic building curriculum, which is again optional if you're already familiar

63
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,210
with logic building.

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,800
So I discuss.

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,710
Few things before you start writing good.

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,260
I discuss floor jokes and go dark, tell you how to think like a programmer given a small problem.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,910
How do we break it down and how do we build logic for the same?

68
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,850
The second part of the course is more C++ specific, and we try to learn with various language constructs,

69
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:02,310
like how to write code that is using effects, ranging concepts, loops, operators, functions, pointers

70
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,810
et is Gutierrez Strings recursion and basics of object oriented programming so that the complete curriculum

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:17,460
of this course and um, and you know the good thing, there are no prerequisites to take this course.

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
So if you are an absolute beginner and if you have not worked with programming anywhere in your life,

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,090
you are at the right point.

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,150
This is the right step to start learning programming, right?

75
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,260
And so I hope you are ready to join me on this journey of learning coding and you will tighten your

76
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,450
seat belt and I will see you in the course.

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,280
Thank you.

78
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,710
Bye bye.
