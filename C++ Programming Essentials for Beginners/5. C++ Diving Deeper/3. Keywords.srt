00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,470
I in this lecture will talk about keywords, which is quite an important concept when it comes to learning

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,580
a programming language.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:17,320
Every language has keywords on whether keywords, so keywords, special words that have a special meaning

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,490
for the compiler will get.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,190
That means they are kind of resolved.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:28,300
You cannot use these names for any other purpose, like you cannot use these keywords for giving a name

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,820
to a function or giving a name to a variable.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,080
You cannot use them, OK.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,260
These keywords cannot be used as identified.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,570
That is what you need to know on C++ as 95 reserved words.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,030
So you do not need to memorize how many keywords are there or what all those keywords.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,470
But I will give you a quick look of what kind of words in a programming language like C and C++.

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,290
You will find and we can call them as keyword tool kit.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:05,200
For example, a word like LS, you will use it very frequently word like long, which is kind of a data

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,500
type.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,190
It's like double auto brake.

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,670
God, Gonzales Lord.

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:13,860
Continue.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,530
OK.

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,960
So we are going to see a lot of them while we are going to write code, OK?

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,620
All these are examples of keywords, right?

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,730
And there are 32 keywords which are both common in C and D Plus Plus, and there are some new keywords

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,430
which were introduced in C++, for example.

24
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,950
A keyword is a namespace is a keyword.

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,030
Rent is a world class, is a keyword.

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,330
The glass is used in object oriented programming.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:53,010
D is not an object oriented language, but C++, as C++ has the keyword called class and that is true.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:00,280
Falls and type name public private operator OK.

29
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,120
A lot of lot of keywords you can see are dead and you cannot use these keywords.

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,760
Giving a name to a particular variable look.

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:21,400
So if we go to this particular code and what we want to identify what all key words this code is using.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,500
So if you look at from the previous example that ended up given in the very beginning and discovered

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:37,200
this in dissolve turkey, but if it also achieved OK, this is achieved, this far is achieved, this

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,310
it had done is achieved.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,870
OK.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,540
And.

37
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,050
Yeah.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,670
So you can see there are a lot of key words we are using in our particular program.

39
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,150
OK.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,870
And we're going to see this Ford is actually a key word, right?

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
That is what I was trying to show you here.

42
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,650
This fight isn't even particularly vile.

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,600
It'll give it these key words.

44
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,820
Each word has a special meaning.

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:08,050
For example, the four key word is used to create a loop and loop is used.

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,790
If you want to do something again and again in every program, you will find there are certain keywords

47
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,600
which are specific to that particular language, and many different languages can also have same keywords,

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,500
for example.

49
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,330
The fight is also given in Java.

50
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,960
It's also keyword invite.

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,620
Then it's a very commonly used keyword, right?

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,830
And that's all about key words that you need to know, and in the next few days, we'll talk about the

53
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,210
concept of mean.
