00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,710
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,730
So till now, we have been writing programs on in some of the programs, you might have seen that I've

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,010
written something that starts from the last.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,920
This thing is actually known as a comment.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,280
OK, so what is a common comment is just a piece of text that is ignored by the compiler.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,380
It is basically to tell.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,060
It's basically to annotate what your code is doing.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,990
Or we can use this command to explain something inside the code.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,260
OK, so it's just a piece of text that is used to enter the code, and it is ignored by the compiler

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,710
because this is not executed by the compiler.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,660
And we can also use comments to make certain lines of the code inactive.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,210
For example, I don't want to take input that I want to make this part inactive.

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,240
I can command out this particular line.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,420
We can also command out multiple lines by defining a comment like this.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,700
OK?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,130
So this is known as a multi line comment.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,000
So if you start from the baseline.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,040
So this creates a single line comment.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,790
OK.

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,390
Anything that is written below will not be a comment.

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,470
So this is an example of a multi line comment that I'm trying to show you is here.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,020
So, for example, I want to comment this part out.

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,720
So I will start with backslash start.

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,670
I will write the comment and I will end with Star Backslash.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,010
So this creates a Maryland comment.

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,480
So these are two type two ways of commenting your code in C++.

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,540
So we have seen that we can write a single line automatically line comment in a C++ program.

28
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,900
So that's all for this video.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,410
Thank you.
