1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,950
Everyone, so in this lecture, we are going to talk about consent to consent, as the name suggests.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,240
They are the values in programming which cannot be modified once they are defined.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,420
That means they are read only values.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,620
They cannot be changed.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,890
So there are two basic ways of creating consent.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,180
One is using a preprocessor directive, which does create something which is known as a symbolic constant

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,410
OK.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,350
And using a guns reward, this actually creates buckets in the memory, which are read only I took it.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,430
So we'll talk about it always and we'll show you the demo as well.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,650
We'll get these buckets are read only.

11
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,380
That means they can be created and initialized only once.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
So what example Gonzales float by?

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,950
So you can use Gonski with a flawed guide on any other day today?

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,220
That means that particular bucket is read only.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,780
We're not going to upgrade the value.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,470
So if you try to upgrade the value of that bucket, you're going to get an error.

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:00,860
OK.

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,180
And.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,300
Another thing is you cannot create a book that is concerned and later you're going to say no.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,370
So this is not a valid operation that means you're forced to create a consent without defining the value.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,090
Initialization is must for consent only then it will get some value in it, OK?

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,600
And another way is using a preprocessor directive.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,710
So I will tell you the difference between the two types of constants in the code demo.

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,680
So maybe let me go to this code and going to find something like how you define.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:43,700
And Isaac, my name is ready, or maybe I defined something like religious faith.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,270
OK.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,610
This is actually.

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,450
This is also known as a macros, we have created a macro.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,980
So what does it means if you do something like out radius in the radius?

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,870
OK, so this is just by replacing this text with five, it is not storing five in the moment, it is

31
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,730
basically doing a calculation.

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,410
In this line, when gold is going to get executed, it is going to replace the value of already with

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:14,860
the fight.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,180
So five is actually a replacement text.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
It is not a bucket in the memory.

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,170
It's a replacement text for the word.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,680
OK.

38
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,370
That is also one way of creating Ogun state, and this type of consent is known as a macro.

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,260
The other way of creating a consent is using a Gonski.

40
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,360
Maybe you define launched by Gonski, flawed by.

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,610
OK, so you have the data type, you have the variable name, and then you look at this should be three

42
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,550
point one four.

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,910
And this value of BI will not change.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,620
If you do, bike was two by plus one, you're going to get an error.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,570
OK, so you're going to cannot assign a variable by with a new value because it is of the type concept.

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,160
So this is a invalid operation, so you cannot do this operation on a constant value.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,630
And what are you going to do?

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,440
You can use this constraint in some explanation you can see out.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,790
Not yet, but we can do it see out by into radius and do radius.

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,780
Maybe something like this.

51
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,480
So if I run this code, I will show you the output as well, right?

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,010
Now you you can see that this is actually OK, we should also give a new line here.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,260
And the list for new line.

54
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,940
So now you get audited and audit.

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,540
We are multiplying the cent and we are getting 25.

56
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,410
And this is defined using a macro.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,200
And here we have used what we have defined by which is a consent, which is a read-only.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,350
Consent created in the memory you get to by is actually a bucket.

59
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,750
It's it's a variable.

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,230
It's a constant variable.

61
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:22,800
Whereas this oddity is just a macro and where it supplies the replacement text when the program is being

62
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,460
getting compiled, this is similar to writing by into five into five look at it is not a book it.

63
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:37,080
Wherever buys a bucket to buy is a read only book it will give when I generally mean ActionScript.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,860
It refers to this country to get drivers to the Gonski world.

65
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,830
I don't use macros that frequently.

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,410
I use one cent more frequently.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Macros are helpful when you want to define some shortcut, maybe you want to define that a little.

68
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,600
The meaning of a well means the keyword long.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,930
Long.

70
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,830
Maybe I don't want to write long, long to create a bucket.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,730
I want to write a little so I can say l l some big number and that is equal to one two three four five.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,820
So what it is going to do, it is going to replace L-l with with the replacement text that is long long.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,750
What if you have values which are constant?

74
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,210
I would recommend you to go with the Gonski, which I hope that clarifies the difference between the

75
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,750
two things.

76
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,820
And that's all for this video.
