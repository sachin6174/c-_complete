1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,080
Everyone's in this lecture, we're going to talk about the storage of negative numbers, OK, well now

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,840
what we have discussed was how the positive numbers are stored.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,730
And we also discussed that integers by default, they are signed on signed integers.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,910
The first bit represent the sign of the number OK.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:33,400
If there is a 32 bit bucket that is divided into two parts, the first bit is used for the sign and

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,780
the remaining 31 bits.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,270
They are used for the magnitude raid.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,930
This is what we have already discussed it.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,090
But if I talk about negative numbers, there is a special.

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,200
Convention that is used to store the negative numbers, OK.

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,930
And it is stored in the form, which is known as Dos Complement Foam.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm going to tell you the reason for it.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,540
OK.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,760
Why they're not stored directly.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,210
OK.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,640
We've overridden a number like a lot of zeros and followed by one zero one.

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,460
So undoubtedly this number is five.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,010
But when it is stored in dos complement foam, it is not exactly fake.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,330
It is something else, right?

20
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,440
And we have the sign, but one note that this number is a negative number.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,590
OK.

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,730
So you can interpret this number as minus five.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,050
But if it is stored in those compliment form, then it is not minus five.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,860
It is something.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,010
So let me tell you that, how do we interpret, but how do we convert a number introduced complement

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,120
form and why this one is needed?

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,990
OK, now let's talk about an operation on numbers like an addiction.

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,750
For example, you are doing, let's say, five plus three.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,520
This will definitely reduce the output rate in order to simulate this operation.

30
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,220
You need additional hardware, right?

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,740
So there must be hardware for doing addition.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,340
And that's as good as known as the circle of elders.

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,560
So this is built inside your processor.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,640
But now suppose I want to do five minus three.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,920
And this should produce two.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,270
That means doing the subtraction would also need additional half of it.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,700
That is special circuit that specializes in doing subtractions.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,530
Now, the people who designed this hardware, they.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,400
I saw some challenges with building this attracted.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,790
One is they will need additional hardware.

41
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,430
Apart from the added to do the subtraction.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,710
So what that orders instead of doing this attraction will not do the subtraction.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,220
We will only the coalition will say, OK, we are adding minus three to five.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,090
And this should reduce the rhetoric to.

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,190
This should produce the result, you may ask how this is possible, this is possible when there's no

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,940
ministry.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,190
This is stored in those complement form.

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,240
If you are storing something and don't complement foam, you will not need to do subtraction.

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,810
You can just do addition and that will behave as a subtraction voter if you're adding you're adding

50
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,060
a negative number to do some of that number.

51
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,780
OK, so that is where this does complement farmers help.

52
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,410
So that means inside the memory, the actual bits, they are going to represent those complement form.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,970
If the first bit S1, OK, and this is true for those assigned integers only OK, because there is no

54
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,840
concept of negative numbers in case of an Iranian leaders refer to the integer or assigning digit the

55
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,720
but one remaining which they are going to be stored in to compliment form.

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,070
Now, how do we get that huge compliment form off of any number, OK?

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,170
There are two steps you need to perform.

58
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,140
The first is suppose you are given a number, let's say you want to generate minus five.

59
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,530
OK.

60
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,650
And let us assume that it is stored in our forward memory, though it would be attached to a good memory.

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,290
And maybe you can take it as a bit memory.

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,400
So how is the number five stored?

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,640
OK?

64
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,820
This is how the number plus five would be stored.

65
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,400
What do you need to?

66
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,590
You need to invert all the bits of any number.

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,870
So if you want to suppose you have a number X and you want to generate the number minus X?

68
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,490
OK.

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,840
Do you want to generate the lowest compliment of minus X, so what it means you will invert?

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,670
All the bits of X.

71
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,540
OK.

72
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,570
And you will add one to it.

73
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,890
I won't do it.

74
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,480
So this is going to be a binary edition.

75
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,220
We have the number plus five and we want to generate the number minus five from last week.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,790
So we have written the binary representation of plus five, which for now it's eight, but indeed it

77
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,260
just to simplify our additions, right?

78
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,880
So we will flip all the bits so it becomes one one one one one.

79
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,240
And zero one zero eight.

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,210
And now we are saying we want to add a one to it.

81
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,370
So let me add one here.

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,040
What this number is, it is a zero plus one one one zero one one one one.

83
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,380
We have five one zero and one.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,880
And this number?

85
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,600
Is the way the minus five is being stored, so we have performed these two steps four step in all bits

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,300
of X and add one to it, so we have inverted all bits of five and added one to it.

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,220
So this gives me the number minus five.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,080
Now you may ask.

89
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,910
Show me a demo of doing a subtraction.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,610
OK, so let us try to subtract five minus five, so we know that this should produce an output of zero.

91
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,060
What we will add five with minus five.

92
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,960
OK.

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,850
And this should produce a zero.

94
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,380
But let's see.

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,400
What does it produce?

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,040
So what is five survivors this number?

97
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,720
So I'm going to write it here.

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,540
We have lots of zeros.

99
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,860
Followed by one zero one, what is minus five?

100
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:27,450
We have one one one one one zero one and one, right?

101
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,490
And now we are going to add it.

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,370
So before doing the addition, let me also tell you about the rules of Binary Edition.

103
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,440
OK, how the binary audition happens.

104
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,200
OK, now, if I add zero plus one to that is one one plus zero.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,280
That is also one.

106
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,880
If I have zero zero, that is zero.

107
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,780
If I have one plus one, one plus one is two.

108
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,390
And how do you rate two in binary united?

109
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,350
Like this one?

110
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,070
OK.

111
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,190
That means here we are.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,870
When we're adding one plus one, it is going to produce two.

113
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,040
We are going to put a zero hit and one would be over Kerry to one plus one.

114
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,850
It does zero here and one would be over.

115
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,970
Kerry one plus one zero hit one get one plus one.

116
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:22,780
Then one Kerry won best one one one one one one one one plus one, then one get one with one 10.

117
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,670
And one good note what you can do is you can see is that this one?

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,570
Getty It is going outside the boundary of a big box in case of a 32 bit ball total.

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,220
Similar thing will happen.

120
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,790
It will go outside the boundary of the 32 bit box and hence this Kerry would be discarded.

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,590
Again, this will not get stored because it is going outside the boundary of the bucket.

122
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,090
And what is this number?

123
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,090
This number is nothing but the number zero that means this will complement form actually works.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,390
And this is how the minus five is being stored inside the memory of computer.

125
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,910
This number is not minus five.

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,880
If it is stored in those complement form, this is something else.

127
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,450
OK.

128
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,800
So I hope this edition using does complement form is clear.

129
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,390
I will also show you one thing the both of you want to figure out what?

130
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,590
What does this number OK?

131
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
What is this number?

132
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's say I have written this number and you want to figure out what is this number?

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm curious to know what number is being represented.

134
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:27,760
OK.

135
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,570
So let us say that, OK?

136
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,220
And this number represents some negative number that is minus X.

137
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,240
OK.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,730
And doing all those compliment.

139
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,290
Means we are negotiating a no.

140
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:40,920
OK.

141
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,490
It was a compliment, means we are negotiating a no.

142
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,800
OK, if I take a compliment one more time.

143
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,290
So if I say, let me take those compliment of this, so minus of minus x this year produce plus x.

144
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,440
So what I will do, I will flip all the bits in order to take those compliment.

145
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,400
OK.

146
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,810
And the.

147
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,940
We have zero one zero rate, and I'm going to either one do it.

148
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,000
So I have zero one one one one zero one one, right?

149
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,320
This number now you can interpret it using powers of two.

150
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,200
Because design zero, that means it as a positive number, and you interpret this number by combining

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,870
the powers of two and whatever it is, this number, this number is just a negative of this number,

152
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,040
OK, because we added a minus sign in the beginning.

153
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,540
Let me give you another example, but if I have a number in which everything is just one, let's I have.

154
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,010
One day, right?

155
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,310
So first thing, I know it is a negative number, but I don't know what this number is.

156
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,720
So if I say, let's say this number is minus X and I negated.

157
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,450
That means I take a dose compliment of it, OK, so that means flip all the bits, make everything as

158
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,490
idle and you add one here.

159
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,610
This number is now zero zero zero one, right?

160
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,810
Basically, magnitude wise, this number is one.

161
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,290
And since the first bit was one, it was a negative number.

162
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:29,660
So this gives us X two x is one and the number was minus X and hence the actual number.

163
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,280
This number represents minus one in its twos complement form.

164
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:34,940
OK.

165
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,610
So this is how you interpret a negative number written in those compliment form.

166
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,710
You negated to get the magnitude and you see the sign read was one and hence it was a positive number.

167
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:46,970
OK.

168
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,860
Now, given any number in the.

169
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,390
In the 32bit format.

170
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:53,960
OK.

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,410
The way you're going to interpret that number, so firstly, you should know, is it stored in the signed

172
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,740
form?

173
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,090
OK, if it is stored in the signed form, then you look at the first bit.

174
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:12,660
If the first bit is one, then you find that those complement of it to get the magnitude and sense of

175
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,490
usbut was one, it was a negative number.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,860
But if the first bit of zero, you can simply interpret this number as double our zero plus two per

177
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,510
one plus two squared plus two Q.

178
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,830
And this number is nothing but eight plus one that is nine.

179
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,720
So this number is nothing but nine of the first 10 zero.

180
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,950
And if there is, if it does contain no look at that, then it becomes easy for us.

181
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,120
It is a positive number.

182
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,510
You simply combine the bubbles of two like we did here as well.

183
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,780
You get what that number is, OK?

184
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,220
I hope that clears out the confusion.

185
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,920
The difference between signed and unsigned integers.

186
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
And that's all for this video.
