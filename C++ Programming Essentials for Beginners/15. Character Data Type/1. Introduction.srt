00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello, everyone, so we are going to start with the new module that is on character, that is strength.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,480
And we will also discuss about the gadget today in little more detail.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,050
What we are going to do is we are going to talk about three things.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,680
One is how connectors work, how they are stored on what are some available functions which you can

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,830
use on the catheter Typekit.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,340
So the part one is only about a single character.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,600
And so we'll talk about gadget today on what library functions we can use in the park to really talk

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,640
about those new style strings, which are also known as connected areas.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:48,430
And we will also look at what are the various functions available like to input output or to find the

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,370
length of the string or get these character arrays.

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,820
They're used to store things like these, either also known as string laterals.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,770
And if you want to perform, read, write operations on those strings, and this is where the character

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,120
is.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,430
They are helpful.

15
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,650
They are also known as E style strings.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,060
And talking about the modern C++, the modern C++ support something which is known as a string class.

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,580
Which is an object oriented programming way of dealing with things will get.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,880
So we'll also talk about the string glass and which is based on the principles of object oriented programming

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,620
more than C++.

20
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,900
We use the strings very frequently, but we learn this ISA style strings as well, starting from the

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,460
basics of the candidate.

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,270
All right.

23
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,710
So that's a quick intro of what we're going to do on to you in the next video.
