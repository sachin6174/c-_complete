1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,340
Everyone, so in this, we do have a small video quiz for you.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,860
And the question is, you have to guess the outputs I will type in some good on.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,160
You need to tell me what the output is going to be, OK?

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,260
The one thing we're going to do, we are going to do C out C C-H plus one.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:19,610
OK.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,300
So, you know, tell me what line number nine is going to print and then I'm going to do C equals c

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,230
h plus one.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,830
And then I'm going to print cottage.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:31,970
OK.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,580
That is the second thing you need to tell me.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:43,910
I'm going to build the code, the positive you do it and think, how line number nine is it same as

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,320
line number 10?

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,390
Will they produce a different output or will they produce the output?

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,220
So just by this, we do anything.

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,520
OK?

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,380
And now I'm going to discuss the solution, so we know that C it equals it.

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,510
So is actually stored as the number sixty five.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,910
That is what is actually stored inside the memory.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,760
And when I'm going to run this school, this line will produce 5:54 and this line will actually produce

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,350
the number, be it.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,830
And let me show you why and how this is happening and why it is true.

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,310
Maybe the Eiglarsh gets the output.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,620
And yes, you can see the output is 66 and be, as I said, and the watching is why, why it is.

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:43,050
So let us look at line number nine right at this line, we are doing an Operation C-H plus one to see

25
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:51,590
it is as stored as 65 and we are adding this God with in trade.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:00,510
So it is actually a higher rate as compared to got any operation you do of a lower rate.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:08,160
With the higher rate, it will get converted into a higher rate and also the plus operator.

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,630
This is a mathematical operator, so it will assume the numbers are indeed doing this operation, it's

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:25,070
going to produce an integer and CO2 does not know CO2 only sees this thing as indeed it does not look,

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
there was a character.

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:33,770
It was dead, but before the addition, OK, after the addition happened, this is actually an integer.

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,440
Since it represents the numbers, 65 zero plus one would be printed as an integer that is 66.

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,600
All right.

34
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,890
Now let's look at line number 10.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,950
So we are doing the eight equals CSI Plus one.

36
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:54,040
So here also it is an integer, but now we're putting it back inside a data type.

37
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,730
That is Scott.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,060
OK.

39
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,120
That means now we have the number 66.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,550
That is stored in a guard type of bucket.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,670
And here we are seeing the old catch, the old will look at what value is this?

42
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,410
Of course, this will lose 5:54 but it is also going to look at what is a rip off.

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,970
See it.

44
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,100
See, it is still look at OK.

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:27,340
That is why this number will not be displayed as 66, but it will be displayed as I hope you found this

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,150
pretty interesting and you also got to learn a concept that adding an integer with a character leads

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,840
to an integer.

48
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,040
And if you put it back inside a but that would be printed as a character because the edge looks at the

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,690
data type of the number or the value that is we are getting, we had that we are going to print, OK.

50
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,250
I hope that's clear to you now.
