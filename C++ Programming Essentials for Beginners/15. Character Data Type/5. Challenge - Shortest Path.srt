00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,960
In this lecture, we're going to solve a problem and problem name is shortage spot.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,510
And it's a pretty interesting problem on strength.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,970
There it is.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,120
You want to go to a certain location which is located at X Como Y.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,100
And you have to start from origin, okay, so doctors aren't zero zero.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:29,050
And your friend is telling you a long way by telling the steps you should walk in each direction and

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,810
the directions are northwest, east or south.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,270
You have to find out the shortest spot.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,410
Okay, so let us look at one example where we have this input and output.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,390
So let me just draw to that extent.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,060
It's a this is not.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,230
This is east, this is West, and this is salt.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,550
And the first step, you have to go north to get the go one step not.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:07,920
Then again, go not OK, then again, go north, which is like these steps, not then you have two steps

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,910
towards the east.

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:17,550
OK, and then you have one step towards West and then you have one step towards south to get this is

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,980
the final location where you will reach to get in order to reach this location.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,580
What could be the shortest spot so you could have simply done?

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,810
You could have said, OK, I will go two steps north and I will go one step east and I will arrive at

21
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,100
this particular coordinate.

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,270
This is what you wanted to do and out.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,790
What do you see?

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,410
It is north, not on these.

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,310
Other thing is, how do we find out what the final guardian index gumawa is starting from the origin

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,300
that is zero zero.

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,920
So the thing is, it's pretty simple.

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,710
So effectively, what you get is that if you're going through steps, not and if you're going few steps

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,430
out.

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,530
You're actually reducing your distance traveled along by axis.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,110
This is your Y-axis and this is your x axis.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,530
What do you need to do?

33
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,460
You need to find out the net displacement in the vertical direction and also in the horizontal direction.

34
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,550
You need to find out how much we have to walk horizontally and how much we have to walk in the vertical

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,960
direction.

36
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,990
That is what you need to do.

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:34,260
That means whenever you see a north or south, you will update your y coordinate, and whenever you

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,220
will see east or west, you will update your X coordinate, OK?

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,470
In the beginning, both X and Y the R zero right.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,070
So x zero by zero.

41
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,460
You are going north.

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,250
That means you are going towards the positive axis.

43
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,490
Your Y becomes one again, not it becomes two again, not it becomes three.

44
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,400
Then you go east, so your X becomes one.

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,990
One, that is two.

46
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,590
Now you go west.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,260
So this means you are going in this direction, so you will reduce your X coordinate by one.

48
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,270
It becomes minus one.

49
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,170
Then you will.

50
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,810
So that means you are going down.

51
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,190
So you reduce your y coordinate by one.

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:18,660
So effectively, you have all for the y axis and you have x coordinate as one.

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,000
Basically, your final location x gumawa is actually one to.

54
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:31,890
Now, depending on the Guardian, it took a quadrant so it can lie in quadrant one, you one, it can

55
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,540
lie in Quadrant two, it can lie in Quadrant three and it can also line Quadrant four.

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,080
OK.

57
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,270
It lies in Q1, so you will print the value of.

58
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,980
Not two times.

59
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,420
So you will see an alternate on since the X coordinate is one that means we are on the positive side,

60
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,910
the positive side means we are in the East.

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,870
You will be one thing if that is what you are going to do.

62
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,680
So output would be an any or it could be CNN and then both are fine.

63
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:14,830
And if you are asked to print this in lexical graphical sorted manner, you can print it first and you

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,540
can print and later on.

65
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,930
OK, so it could be CNN, or it could be in any water fine as output.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,280
I hope you have understood this problem.

67
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,270
So what do you need to do?

68
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,720
Firstly, you need to find out the final displacement, the final value of X and Y coordinates, and

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,050
then you need to convert this into a corresponding string.

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,500
OK.

71
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,410
Which again, can be done using a loop.

72
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,790
OK.

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,120
So let us try to see how we can go this problem up in the next lecture.

74
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,770
And that's all for this video.
