00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,920
Everyone in this lecture will talk about elections, our algorithm, so it's again, a very simple algorithm

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,920
and based upon the very basic idea that we every time what we will do will find out the minimum element

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,090
from the unsorted part of that, and we will put it to the beginning, OK?

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,400
So if it is not clear like this, let us go through one example to understand it better.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,060
For example, we have added like, let's say, three to one five on foot.

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,250
Let's say I want to sort the city using selections out so I can break this error into parts.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,410
Let's say currently, I'm at this particular position and the rest of the error is unsorted.

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,130
Eddie, let's say two one five foot so we can see we will pick one element that is minimum from the

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,180
unsorted part and we will bring it to the current position, OK?

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,020
So what is the element that is minimum in this part?

11
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,430
We know this element is one.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,280
So we will iterate over this unsorted, but we will take one element that is minimum and we will bring

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,040
it to the fact we know one is minimum.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,690
So we will put one here and we will swap with three here, OK?

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,080
So now we know that at least this element is in the right position and we can go to this particular

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,990
element, okay, so now what we have, we have one comma two.

17
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,790
This is the position we are talking about and the rest of the is not sorted.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,290
That is three five foot.

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,810
We figured out what is the minimum element in the rest of the body, including this element.

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,760
We can see the minimum element unto itself and it means it is in the right position.

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,290
We don't do anything OK.

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,310
So next time what we do, we know we have one two which are in the right position.

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,770
We are the position of this element.

24
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,370
Three.

25
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,460
And again, if you see what is a minimum in these three elements.

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,730
So it's again three, we will not do anything.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,210
We will move on to the next element.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,030
We have one two three that in the right position.

29
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,610
We move to the next element that is five.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,910
This is in the current position and we have this part of that is underwater right now.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,230
We take what is the minimum element in this area.

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,010
So we know this is for two weeks rapid with the element, which is the current position.

33
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,050
So we get one two three four.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,250
And if you start n minus one elements of the three, that means you have already figured out the N minus

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,990
one elements that should come in the first and minus one positions.

36
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,670
Then automatically the last element would be in the right position.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,920
OK?

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,670
So this is the whole idea of doing this election.

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,910
So OK, so it's a very simple and easy algorithm to implement, and in the next lecture, we will discuss

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,210
the implementation of selection talked.
