00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,130
In this lecture will discuss the implementation of indigenous art.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,040
So I'm going to complete this method intentions, art on what we learned this every time we perform

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,450
this process of insertion.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,020
What happens is we start from this index and we try to insert in the next location, then we try to

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,940
enter to in the right location, then we try to insert one in the litigation and then we try to insert

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,080
six in the right location.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,260
So basically from one to n minus one.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,370
OK, so we start from index one until index and minus one.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,220
We want to place these elements in the right position or get placed these elements in the right index.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,690
The right position, you can see.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,120
So what we're going to do?

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,380
We are going to.

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:03,640
See, Ford and I quote one I less than equals and minus one or less than an A-plus plus, so effectively

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,830
we're going going to run this loop and minus one times because if and minus one elements are in the

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,650
right index, then everything is sorted.

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:20,580
So our current element is nothing, but it's at Delphi and the previous element, which is just before

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,850
current, so that there's nothing word that isn't index a minus one.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,080
I will give you one example.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,950
Let's say you have already you have already started this array.

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,200
Like, let's say you have.

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,870
Two, three, five.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,980
And what you want is you want to insert one in the right index.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,600
We'll start from the previous.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,170
Does this previous and this is the current element.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,770
So we have already copied one in a bucket called current that we have created a copy of one.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:03,960
And what we did see, while this previous is greater than equal to zero and ADF previous is greater

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
than current.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,350
So what we will do, we will say, let's move these elements one step ahead.

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,730
So I can say area of previous plus one that should be equal to ADF previous and previous should go back

31
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,360
one step.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,840
So if you just execute this loop on this?

33
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,640
On this state of the river, what is going to happen is the rent is already equal to one.

34
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,420
And this is previous.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,150
This is also previous plus one.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,130
So we are saying, but if this is greater than equal to zero, yes, and at previous is greater than

37
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,290
good.

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,990
Yes, five is greater than current.

39
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,550
So we move, we copy five at this particular index.

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
OK, so here we now have five.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,330
OK.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,440
And if I draw using a different color, so we are putting a five year and previous goes, one goes back,

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,980
one steps.

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,940
The previous comes here.

45
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,790
We check if reversed is greater than current.

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,590
So what is correct?

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,650
But on this one, so is three greater than one.

48
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,480
The answer is yes.

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,710
Yes, it does.

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,980
So we put out of previous plus one equal the previous insert of this five, we pull the trigger and

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,280
previous comes back one step which is still greater than one than today's.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,700
Yes.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,790
So we say, OK, reverse +1 should be equal the previous.

54
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,040
So we put a two here, OK?

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,650
And previous goes back one step.

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,190
OK.

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,990
Finally, we end up either index that is actually minus one.

58
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:43,990
So in that case, what we are going to do wherever the previous stops in the next place of doubt, we

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,320
are going to put the element that is equal to current.

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,280
So finally, after this loop is over, begin to erode.

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,550
Previous This array of previous plus one should be equal to the current element.

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,210
That's it.

63
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,380
So what we did, we put one from here to here.

64
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Now, if you see what this added becomes, this now becomes one, two, three and five, one, two,

65
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,190
three and five.

66
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,180
OK.

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,580
And maybe, let's say, instead of having a six year, you had afforded OK, in that case, what you

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,550
will do your first copy this dual current.

69
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,620
OK.

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,710
And then you will think previous, it's five greater than four.

71
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,190
Yes.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,290
The previous plus one is this index.

73
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,480
You put a five year current already as forward and you move.

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,430
Previous one step back revise.

75
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,600
Comes it OK and add this step you take is three greater than four dancers, nor does not.

76
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,310
So we break this loop.

77
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,410
We come out of this loop and we still get off.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Previous Plus one should be equal to current.

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,540
So this is previous.

80
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,220
This is previous plus one.

81
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,520
We could afford it and we are then we have inserted forward in the right index, so it becomes one,

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,830
two, three, four and five.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,300
I hope this intermediate step of inserting an element in its right position is clear and this will do

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,030
for all the elements from index one, two and minus one.

85
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,090
And this will do insertion site under.

86
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,460
Entirety.

87
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,980
OK.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
That's what we're doing.

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,730
We're using this loop to find we are using this loop to find the right index.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,660
There, the element current should be inserted.

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,360
So that's it.

92
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,950
That's how the insurgents are.

93
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,730
That's going to work.

94
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,580
Now let us save over cold.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,550
And let's build it, and let's try to run it as well.

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,730
And, you know, we are getting those artillery.

97
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,900
That means our insurgents are working perfectly fine.

98
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,190
So that's all.

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,110
Thank you for.
