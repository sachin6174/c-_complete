1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,880
Everyone.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,140
So let's begin the implementation of selections, OK, so what we discussed, we will go from a position

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:15,560
that is initially zero and we will go till the second last element that is equal to N minus two.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,980
And we will do position plus plus OK.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,990
And every position we know what is the current element.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,040
So the current element is nothing but area of position, that is the current element.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,800
Let me draw one example 02.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,860
Let's say we have a reverse order that is five, four, one, three and two.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,580
Let's say this is how that it looks like.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,950
So currently this is the position the entire date is and.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,350
We will find out what is the minimum in this IndiaToday.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,760
And we will put it to the front.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:56,420
So we will say, OK, -- Variable G, that starts from position and it goes till the last element

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,280
and we do J Plus Plus.

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,000
So what we can take, we can find out the minimum element, OK, so using this loop to find out the

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
minimum element.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,510
OK, so first we will find the minimum element once we know which is the minimum element we will do

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,950
swapping outside the loop.

19
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,520
OK, outside the loop, we will do the swapping so we can say, OK, the minimum sulphide is let's have

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,660
five, so we can initialize the minimum element.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,010
So let's imagine a minimum so far we can see.

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,140
Or let us simply compare with the current itself, OK?

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,630
OK, let me just do something good if I can to area off.

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,580
Gee, that is the current element.

25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,450
It is less than than sort of storing the element.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,220
We can actually store the position, OK?

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,310
You can store what is the position of the minimum element.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,750
So we can say this is a variable which will store the index of.

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,400
Minimum living, OK?

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,160
They need to define this variable.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,310
So I can say in the beginning, the minimum position is same as position, but if you find an element

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,710
that is smaller than added off main position in that case, you can update many position as.

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,410
OK, so what is going to happen?

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,330
You move on to the next this element.

35
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,510
You see, this forward is smaller than what is at often positions.

36
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,900
I don't mean bush in his faith.

37
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,860
So you update your main position to this variable.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,540
So your main comes here next time you go to one.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,290
You take closely.

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,760
You go to bed.

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,270
Five is for less than five batteries.

42
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,570
Yes.

43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,800
We update your mind.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,650
Next time you compare one less, then forward because you have already updated main position.

45
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,210
So you are comes to this point.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,510
Next time to take is three less than one.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,620
That is no, we will not do anything.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,180
Next time you check is to less than one Dhanteras.

49
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,040
Finally, your main position points to one and your position points to five.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,740
You will strap five and one.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:17,520
OK, so we can see outside the loop we are going to swap array off min position and area off position.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,240
That's it.

53
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,570
And if you keep on doing this for all positions from zero to and minus two, this is in minus one.

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,960
This is n minus two, as we discussed in the last video.

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,690
We only need to do so at this point because if you thought and minus one element, the last element

56
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,520
would automatically get sorted.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,000
OK.

58
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,850
So that's the whole idea of doing selection type.

59
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,760
So what we can do, we can then this court, and if it is not clear, we will do that right and also.

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,210
OK.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
So this is it.

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Let's build a code.

63
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,790
OK.

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,020
This this should be selections.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,280
Art.

66
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,010
And now we are going to go.

67
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,620
And you can see we are getting this already, and this is working fine as well.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
So that's good.

69
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,140
Let's quickly try it, and this could lead to five four one three two later.

70
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:19,950
This is the eddy.

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,380
In the beginning, position is zero.

72
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,070
We are here.

73
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,640
We start from day called opposition day LA than we are outraged over this.

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,660
Indeed, Eddy and we find out where is the main opposition.

75
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,970
OK, so we get to know about this element.

76
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,890
This is the minimum.

77
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,940
And after we know the minimum, we swap out of main position and position.

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
So we swap one in five.

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,410
It becomes one four five three two.

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,470
Next time we have this as untitled eddy, this is position the Sasman position as well.

81
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,740
Then we iterate on this part and we see what is the minimum.

82
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,490
So we see this is the minimum we swap for and do so it becomes one two five three four.

83
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,730
Next time we have this part, we see what is the minimum three is the minimum, so it becomes one two

84
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,330
three by foot.

85
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,840
Next time we have this part, this is position and this is in minus two.

86
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,180
We see what is the minimum in this part because it's for what we do one, two, three, four and five.

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,560
And that's it.

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,790
OK, we saw you worked for N minus one element and you can do this loop is actually running and minus

89
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,530
one times, OK, so from zero to n minus two, we have and minus one iterations.

90
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,680
And this element is automatically sorted.

91
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,970
So that's selection's out for you.

92
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,870
Let's let's discuss intelligence art in the next lecture.
