00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:09,250
Everyone in this lecture, we will talk about some common operations that we can do using great ways

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:09,880
operators.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,580
So let us look at some examples.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,490
Let's say we want to get the I a bit of a no.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,530
For example, let's say the number is five.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,640
And in binary, it would look something like this zero zero one zero one and the numbering of bags that

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm going to do is from the right.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,730
So this is the zero Typekit.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,430
This is the first, but this is the second and so on.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,580
If I say, OK, give me the second, but then I'm talking about this, but I want to check the value

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,780
of this particular debate, OK?

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,740
Similarly, there would be a function like that I admit or update, I admit, then clearer, it would

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,450
then clear a range of it.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,470
So we are going to see multiple functions in this set of lectures.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,660
So let us start with the first one.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,590
I want to get the IoT back.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,700
Often, no.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,670
And so now you may ask, OK, how we can extract that Typekit, so it's going to be pretty easy itself

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,150
and his faith and the position of the desire that I'm going to take input, OK?

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,530
And we will bring the IoT big of.

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:21,780
The number.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,410
OK, so now let's see how we can do it, so we know we can use device operators, we're told.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,360
So if I do something like this, if I have, let's say, one zero one, OK.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,560
And I actually want to extract this particular bit.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,540
So we have seen how to get the last word OK.

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:48,050
So we basically do with the armed wing of one, but doing it and one will not help us in this case.

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,680
So what we want, we actually want a variable in which we have, uh.

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,060
We have one at this particular location and everything else is going to be zero, so if I put everything

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,330
else as zero, then I will get this number.

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,130
And how do I get this number?

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,150
There is nothing, but it is one left shift.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,150
I, if you left shift one items.

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,560
Okay, so I is two, OK and we are talking about zero one.

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,930
We are talking about this week.

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,290
So one left you have two basically means this number one zero zero, which is this.

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,180
And if you do and here what you're going to get, you're going to get a number.

37
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,670
Zero zero zero one zero zero.

38
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,410
OK, because everything else is zero.

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,120
So doing a nine will convert everything else into zero.

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,210
And for this position, since you have one here, so doing around with one will give you this number.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,240
Now you can check if this number is greater than zero.

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,950
That means the better one.

43
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,480
And if this number is equal to zero, OK, which would happen if this were to zero, then you can say

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,340
this is actually zero.

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,960
So what we need to do, we need to create a small variable little mosque.

46
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,260
OK, I'm calling this number as a mosque and we will do the and with the mosque will get to mosques.

47
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,240
And I think one left shift I and I can see the last bit is nothing but the number and mosque.

48
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,840
OK.

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,370
If I do that and and if it gives me a desert which is greater than zero, then I can return one.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,960
Otherwise, I can return zero and this is going to give me the IoT big.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,110
So let's run the code and see.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,450
So if I do Dodge Slash while I'm on operations, I could tell you in the second part of five, there

53
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:43,950
it is one.

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,960
Tell me the first bit.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,040
It does zero.

56
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,120
Tell me what does it not?

57
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,570
It does one that means it is working fine.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,180
So that's all for this lecture.

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,190
See you in the next video.
