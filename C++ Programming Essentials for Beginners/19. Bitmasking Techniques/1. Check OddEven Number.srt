00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,240
Everyone, now we are going to look at very small example of a device operator.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,170
So we need to write a function to check whether a number is or not even OK, so not even a function.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,350
Even we can write a small expression to check whether a number is or not even OK.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,050
So one thing you might know is vegan simply do.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,620
And less do if this gives us zero, then we can say the number is even if it gives us one, the number

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,240
isn't OK.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,950
But since we are learning about Bitwise operators, we want to solve this problem using the Bitwise

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,400
operator.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,510
The one thing you will observe is all the hard numbers will have the last word as one and all the even

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,840
numbers will have last, but does zero.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,240
OK, so I'm writing for.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,520
So this number is one.

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,980
This number is two, this number is three.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,420
This number is four.

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,010
This number is five.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,090
One thing you can clearly observe is what are the number four four numbers?

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,070
The last word is one.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,920
And it contributes to the triple zero.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,510
That is one Sudans.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,400
And that is what it makes the number look.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,550
So everything else is that you are no OK.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,130
Everything else is that you are number.

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,610
That means the last, but decide whether the number would be hard or it would be even.

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,950
What we need to do.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,530
We need to check if last bit as one.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,410
Or it is not OK, what we can do is, let's say we have some numbered zero zero zero one zero one zero

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,040
one one.

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,050
What we can do, we can do.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,080
And with this one?

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,740
OK, what is this one?

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,160
This one is studying where zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero and one if you do an idea and what

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,790
could be a possibility doing it?

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,010
And so we have lots of zeros.

34
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,680
Yet the only thing we will get these are the last positions.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,020
If the last position is one, that means this position was one, OK?

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,000
And that means there's no resort.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,960
But suppose the last position, if it is zero, then we will get a zero hit.

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,540
That means this number is actually even OK.

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,140
So I hope you understood how we can check whether the numbers are not even the let me show you a quick

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,530
demo in the court as well.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,730
So if I have, let's say.

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,990
They scored.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:42,450
I can simply wonder if those so index see next, I can check if X and one I can see out art is I can

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,050
see out.

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:55,290
So, Dalsgaard, if I give five survivors or if I give it it is even if I give 32.

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,040
It's hard.

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,410
It's even if I give 33.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,880
It's hard, OK, 32 days, even 33 years old.

49
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,270
So I hope now you understood how we can use this and one who find out the last word.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,390
OK.

51
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,910
And that's it.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,740
That's it for this lecture.

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,900
So thank you for watching.

54
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,440
Goodbye.
