00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,250
Everyone in this lecture, I will teach you an interesting property, how you can check whether a number

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,440
is a power of two or not.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,790
OK.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,480
And we will use Bitwise operators to do this check.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,710
So let us talk about the power of two, let's say, 16, the number, which is a power of two or eight,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,030
the number, which is a power of two thought is 16 16 in binary.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,930
Looks like this.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,640
Yes.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,180
And what I can do is this led to this number is in.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,370
Can you tell me what would be n minus one two?

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,030
Clearly, we know the N minus one would be.

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,410
Something like this, if and if and is about off.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,080
OK, so we know event is a power of two, then the previous number would look something like this.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,240
So there's no reason to live.

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:59,660
Have been an interesting property is if an is a power of two, then doing the end of these two will

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,430
always give me a zero.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,060
OK.

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,090
And you can see this number is zero.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,110
It is true for eight and seven as well if it is like this.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,490
And seven is like this.

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,440
And if you do it and it of eight and seven, then you will get the number zero.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,330
But this will not be true for any other number.

23
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,060
For example, five five is one zero one.

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,110
What is Ford?

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,190
So Ford is one double zero.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,370
And if you do it it, you will not get a zero.

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,850
OK.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:38,110
So basically, the check is if if you get something like this, if and and and minus one, if they produce

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,240
a result that is equal to zero, then that means inizio power off.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,440
OK.

31
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,210
So simply what we can do in the cold, we can take input end and they can check if and and and minus

32
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,540
one.

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,420
And I mean, we put a record here.

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,100
If this is equal to zero, then you can see CO2.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,370
Yes, power of two.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,690
As you can see, not a power of two.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,390
OK, so let's relate.

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,720
Ran it and take it quickly.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,020
So wonder indeed.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,790
Yes, it is a bubble of two, one, two and 144.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,610
It's not the power of two.

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,490
OK, and one 024 is a power of two.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,520
And 12, it's not over.

44
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,950
So yes, it's working fine.

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:46,090
So it's romantic without doing anything with just this island operation with and minus one, we can

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,210
tell whether a number is Bobroff do or not.

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,120
That's it for this lecture.

48
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,670
Thank you.
