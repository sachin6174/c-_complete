1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,870
Everyone, so now we're going to talk about how you can do forced experimentation using wet masking,

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,750
so you might not have heard about this dumb bird.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,340
But this is an important concept that we use as a problem in many of the problems because a lot of experimentation,

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,950
it's basically computing, it is truly power and there is no art and there's also an ability of favorites

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,790
to the power three.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,440
This is 125.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,960
OK, let it relates to the power of faith and it says three multiplied by five times.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,850
OK, so train to trains 927 into three is 81.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,270
81 into three years to 43.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,610
OK.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,670
So this is what five six one engine means.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,480
And if you simply do this multiplication and number of times, it will easily take orders of any time.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,820
But we are going to do it in a better manner.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,150
We are going to do it in a log of and day, and I will teach you how you can do it.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,500
OK.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,270
So let's say we have some number a let's say, three and we have and let's have faith and we want to

17
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,070
compute it is to devouring.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,160
So what I will tell you is you try to visualize this operation like this.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,750
This is three days to deepen our faith.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,400
And what do you do?

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,660
You convert this faith into its binary representation, let's say three days to the one zero one.

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:22,940
OK.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,330
So this is just for understanding purpose.

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,150
And later, we will see how to read it in the form of a good.

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,520
So what this basically tells us, if you talk about how many bits a number is going to have, so any

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,600
number and will have it most than words if you talk about letter number 15 15 has four words that is

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,000
log off 16 or 15 plus one, that is.

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,020
So one more than log of and let's in the worst case.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,860
And let's talk about the number eight.

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,340
OK.

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,430
It also has one triple zero.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,680
So that is again, log off and plus one that is that most number of bits that it is going to have a

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,820
log of it is three plus one that is four.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,320
It is being diagnosed four, which is what is 15.

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,040
The log of have been is roughly close to four.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,740
Four plus one is five or it is three three plus one is for that, most of which it is going to have.

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,370
So for any number, then we are going to have at most log in number of setbacks.

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,610
OK, although every number is a 32 bit number.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,200
What I'm saying the last segment would be a deposition log in or log in, plus one, get that.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,970
That's a property that we should note.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,840
So what we need to do is if you're writing, it is to the power in, let's say, three and is five.

42
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,220
So we will write or get three is one zero one.

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,510
And what we are doing, we're going to iterate over these positions.

44
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,910
We'll give you a window outraged over the bits of N.

45
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,080
And every time what we can do, we can generate some powers.

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,730
OK, so at this point, this is nothing, but we can write it as.

47
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,670
The number itself at this point, we can rotate it as a squad.

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,580
And at this point, we're going to write it as if what we're doing as we're going from left to right.

49
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,290
We are going to do a work.

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,600
We are going to start from.

51
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,840
It is to devour one.

52
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,380
And every time we are going to the next bit, we are going to square the previous power.

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,070
OK, so now what you can observe is, you know, if you if you are able to generate these powers and

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,920
then by multiplying a subset of these powers, you can actually get relays to the power of faith hope.

55
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:53,510
So if you look carefully that this is one if you pick this power and if you discard this power and if

56
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,000
you put this forward and if you multiply these two, what you are doing get you're going to get it is

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,900
to power forward.

58
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,700
Multiplied by eight is to devour one, which it is to devote faith and is what is three three.

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,640
It has to devote faith.

60
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,690
So this is going to give you the result.

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,120
81 multiplied by three.

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
That is 243.

63
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,470
OK.

64
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:22,300
So basically, by just iterating over the bits of that number, we get to know what, what, what we

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,110
need to multiply.

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,110
Now you may ask how we will implement it.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,840
It's very easy.

68
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,750
So initially, we'll take our answer to be one.

69
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,000
We'll get that there's three illustrative of a zero.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,540
Then we will find out what is the last word of five.

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,320
So it is one.

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,330
And what is the current power we have?

73
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,070
That is it.

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
So we will multiply it, answer with it.

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,730
We will discard this, but we will move on to the next position and we will square our value.

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,050
OK, so let's say.

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Ballad of.

78
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:58,600
So this was initially one, this was then after the next step, this bubble became a squid and the big

79
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,860
what is the next bit?

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,470
Initially, the world was one, the next big zero.

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,500
If it is zero, we're not going to do any work here.

82
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,740
OK, so we go to the next position.

83
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,830
The power of is now a fourth because we squared the previous value and the Britain's No.

84
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,670
One we are talking about desperate.

85
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,440
So if it is one, we are going to multiply this effort in never answered.

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,410
And our answer is going to become your faith.

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,460
And now if you extract the next book, it is going to be become zero.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,710
And we we are we have already covered all the segments of Facebook and we are finally what we are going

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,040
to have.

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,120
You're going to have, Iran said.

91
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,130
That is equal to a faith.

92
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,670
OK.

93
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:47,050
And since this number in her blog, in which we could just find out this in order of love in vain.

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,020
So I hope this concept is clear, and now we can quickly jump into the as well.

95
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,170
So I'm going to write the method, let's.

96
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,360
And first explain intuition, then I get the number.

97
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,370
I get the number and I can say, OK, let's assume overruns.

98
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,000
It is one.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,070
And while this number and this is greater than zero, we are going to find out the last word, last

100
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,780
word does not invert and then one and have the last word said.

101
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,340
Then we are going to do some work.

102
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,390
Otherwise, we are just going to compute the next biography.

103
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,360
The next biography would be it.

104
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,180
That is, the previous power into itself squared the previous research.

105
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,010
And then and would be updated as an equal to end right shift one.

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,850
Every time we are discarding one bit from the right, we are doing an equal when Richard won and initially

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,350
is equal to eight.

108
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,070
So this is a then it becomes in is good and it becomes is good into a good idea for.

109
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,870
So this is actually multiplying the previous powers.

110
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,410
So if the last word is say, then what we need to do, we need to multiply our answer with whatever

111
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,050
until we have multiplied with the current power off.

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:13,260
OK, so that is that may be a that maybe a fraud, whatever it may be, but we know that this air contains

113
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,370
the right power.

114
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:22,410
So from here, what we can do, we can return our answer and we are done, we can say, in a coma and

115
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,880
scene end and begin to see out fast.

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,060
Explain intuition and and and.

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:42,730
And now, if I show it to you how it is going to work, I can see it maybe is three and is five.

118
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:51,730
I get the right answer is to an extent I get the right answer is five, b three and three.

119
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,930
I got the right answer.

120
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,600
I hope this is now clear.

121
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,210
This is what we are exactly doing.

122
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,710
We are upgrading of it answered when the last word is one and we will also have the right power of a

123
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,620
generator because of this repeated squaring of the values.

124
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,750
OK, so that's it for this lecture.

125
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,260
Thank you.
