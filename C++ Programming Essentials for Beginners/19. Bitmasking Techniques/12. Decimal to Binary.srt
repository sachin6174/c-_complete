00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:08,690
Everyone in this lecture, we're going to discuss how we can convert a decimal number into its binary

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,490
representation using the Bitwise operators, OK?

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,310
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to write a method, invert and convert to.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,790
Binary, and I'm going to get to Digit.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,430
And let's say they're indeed it is nine, I will return a number which looks like one zero zero one.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,880
OK.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,530
So am I doing this or this enough?

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,970
I'm over.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,120
Indeed, it.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,280
Now, let's see how we can solve this problem, so it's easy.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,190
What we need to do is, let's say this is a no.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,850
And we know how to extract the last breath every time we will extract this bit and we'll create the

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,690
answer variable.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,730
OK, the answer is initially zero, we will add one to it.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,700
It will become one.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,910
OK, our next time we're going to discard this bit by doing the right shift and equal to end right shift

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,240
one.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,380
And we are also going to maintain a power is initially one that will multiply one with one and add to

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,330
the undertow because it is exactly one into one.

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,750
We next time this is actually 10 days to depart zero.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,550
This is ten days to the one.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,940
This is ten square and desist and what we're going to do.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,240
We're going to generate the powers of time in the next iteration.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,620
This power would be come in and we see this better zero.

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,530
OK, so this is what we will do will do zero.

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,610
And then the answer is not going to change, but we are going to discard this and we are going to go

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,710
ahead and the pilot will become 10 squid.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,070
So next time we get this bit, this is zero and multiply 10 squid.

29
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,340
This is zero and it is not going to change.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,410
It is still still one.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,990
But next time, what is going to happen will discard this debate is going to become 10Q and we see this

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,650
better one.

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,860
OK, so this bit is one basically we can see for this big move on the island one thousand over answered.

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,640
So we will add one in ten days to the power three.

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,770
If you see what would be your final answer, it would be one plus and is do three.

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,290
That is, it's going to be one thousand one.

37
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,580
And this is how the binary representation of nine would look like.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,900
OK.

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,220
So I hope you understood the logic now and try to go to it yourself.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,090
And if you are stuck, then take the help from this tutorial.

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:33,290
So what I'm going to do and when you take input and I'm going to convert it into binary, OK?

42
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,940
And what I can do, I can see initially, the answer is zero.

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,560
The power is one.

44
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:47,450
And while this end is greater than zero, I'm going to extract the last bit that is and then one.

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,810
And I'm going to add something to my answer.

46
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,250
So answer would be incremented by a value of power in the last bit.

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,560
And for the next iteration, power will be multiplied with the then.

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,570
Initially, it is one then a decision, then then good and then Dan Gilbert and and would be there to

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,610
that end, right shift one.

50
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,280
That's it.

51
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,480
And we are done.

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,110
And from here, we can return the incident.

53
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:24,070
Let's build the gold, so begin to see out, convert to binary and we give the input and here.

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,630
And now let us boast over cold weather, it looks fine or not.

55
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,320
So what we need to do is go to the terminal and I can convert.

56
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,390
Decimal, divine.

57
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:39,930
OK.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
No, Austin.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,200
OK, so if I give then as in bodyguard, one zero one zero as the output, which is fine, if I give

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,120
15, then I get one one one, which is the binary representation of this particular number.

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,450
That's all.

62
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,070
Thank you.
