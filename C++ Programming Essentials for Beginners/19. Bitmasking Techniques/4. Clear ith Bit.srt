00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,370
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,440
So now we are going to look at how we can clear the air Typekit OK.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,610
So basically if we have a number like, let's say, one one zero one and I want to delete this word

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,090
and I want to make it zero, OK, I want to clear the I had it, so I is due for this example.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,160
Let's see what I need to do.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,380
I need to create a number in which only this zero.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:37,250
Only this bitter zero and rest, everything else is going to be won, so I need this as zero and rest,

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,140
everything is one.

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,820
Look, can you guess how we can get this particular kind of a number, OK?

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,980
The one thing we know is that we want to work on the of so we can create a mosque using one love Jeff

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,230
Day.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,270
It will give us something like this zero one zero zero.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,860
OK, that is fine.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,930
And how do we get this number?

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,940
It is nothing, but it's a.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,580
It's a not of this number, so but why not?

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,480
So what we need to do, we need to do a negation here and we once we are getting this, what we can

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
do, we can do.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,720
And if we do it and all these beds will be reserved, so we will get one zero one.

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,400
And since we have a zero here, zero and something, it is going to get zero.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,110
So that's it.

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,740
So this is going to clear the eye had the boot.

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,100
So if I show you the mosque now, the mosque is going to be nothing, but not off one day.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,690
And what you need to do, you need to update the world often so you don't need to set any goals do and

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,320
mosque and we are done then sort of calling retired.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,420
But I'm going to call earlier.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,820
I had to I give in and I.

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,000
And let us clear the air.

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,120
So this number isn't what.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,020
One two four eight.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,230
This is this number is 13.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,860
So if I say, let's end it 13, and I want to clear the second, but.

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,340
If 13, I want to clear the second.

34
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,450
I should get a number, which is nine zero one two.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,870
Yes.

36
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,730
So let's see.

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,850
I want to clear the skin, but oh.

38
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,480
OK, I need to run this code, build this code first.

39
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,330
The first lady is second convict.

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm getting the output, which is exactly equal to nine.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,050
OK.

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:42,550
So I hope this is clear to you and this is how we can clear any break in a number.
