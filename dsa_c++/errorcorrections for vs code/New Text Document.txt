f you are running into an error saying that your script "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system" while trying to run a script in Powershell, on Windows 10, you have to change the execution policies first.

Commands Shown:
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

If PowerShell throws up an error message â€“ File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system, then you need to enable script running on your Windows 10 computer. The cause of this error comes to the fact that your user account does not have enough permissions to execute that script. This does not mean that you need to have an Administrator level permissions, it also means that you also need to be unrestricted to run these type of PowerShell scripts or cmdlets
